Small rainclouds race through the sky as the sun emerges from behind the jungle canopy, illuminating the vibrant landscape.

A blond-haired &lt;span class=&#39;secretlink&#39;&gt; (link: &quot;French Canadian&quot;)[Québécois]&lt;/span&gt; man with a blue jacket and Capri pants admires the view from atop one particularly high foothill.

$v[&quot;Such a beautiful sight, isn&#39;t it?&quot;] He turns to face the camera. $v[&quot;We&#39;re here in the Andean mountains of Peru, right before the hills give way to the Amazon rainforest below and away. The crossroads of high and low, of wet and dry. And now, co-operation and competition.&quot;]

A shot of the challenge area is shown. There are walls enclosing an elevated plateau atop one foothill, with a single path leading in. Three banners flutter in the wind opposite the entrance – $q[one a dark indigo], $o[one a medium green], $c[and one a light pink].

$v[&quot;Here, 18 castaways from all walks of life will come to brave the elements, and each other, to see who is worthy of the title of Sole Survivor. They are playing here, in what was once part of the eastern edge of the great Inca Empire, which for a century was the most prominent civilization this side of the Atlantic. They succeeded without so many of the necessities that were taken for granted in the civilizations of Europe, Asia, and Africa... and this season&#39;s castaways are here to do the same.&quot;]



&#39;&#39;SURVIVOR: INCA LEGACY&#39;&#39;



$v[&quot;We have an exciting season planned for you all, with a number of secrets in store to keep both the players and you at home on your toes,&quot;] says Vincent. He smiles. $v[&quot;So without any further delay, let&#39;s get started. Eighteen castaways... 39 days... one Sole Survivor!&quot;]

Challenge Beach**

Vincent is standing at one side of the challenge beach, with three coloured banners fluttering behind him in the harsh wind.

$v[&quot;Here we are, in the highlands of Peru!&quot;] he calls out, to be heard above the wind. $v[&quot;Any minute now, eighteen contestants from all walks of life will come together to compete in what should be the adventure of a lifetime.&quot;]

The camera switches to a montage of footage of various rainforest animals, including brightly-coloured frogs and a monkey or two. Then, driving between trees on a narrow path, an off-road vehicle is shown carrying six players riding in the back. The camera zooms in on one in particular, a thin girl with brown hair and eyes, pale skin, and a form-fitting red top.

//&quot;I&#39;ve been watching this show since before I knew how to spell its name,&quot; says Denine. She is sitting down in the sand. &quot;I think I have what it takes to go far, and I can only hope that I have fun doing it.&quot;//

Next, as footage of mountains and alpacas plays, Vincent continues. $v[&quot;Peru was once the core to the Inca Empire, one of the greatest civilizations in the Americas. Their empire thrived with few of the advantages enjoyed by those in the Old World, and this season we&#39;re giving our cast even less to work with.&quot;]

The shot switches to show a helicopter flying high above the hills and mountains. Inside, another six competitors sit, watching as they approach their home for at least the next three days, or as many as thirty-nine. A tall, blonde woman with a pink dress and a silver purse leans against the window, looking up at the clouds they are skirting under.

//&quot;Okay, so like it&#39;s going to be really weird not having the basics, like running water, ice machines, that kind of thing? Stuff everyone takes for granted.&quot; Ashleia sighs. &quot;But I&#39;m not, like, weak, okay? I don&#39;t back down from a good challenge.&quot;//

Then, footage of narrow, winding rivers is shown, with a variety of tropical fish and other aquatic wildlife in close-up shots. The shot then shows a speedboat that has reached the challenge beach. As Vincent watches the six competitors climb out of the boat, helping each other with their belongings, he speaks up again. $v[&quot;We have divided the cast into three tribes of six, groups they will need to depend on to survive.]

The final group walks over to Vincent and the tribe mats and banners. They make their way over to the deep indigo mat and stand on it. The camera focuses on the oldest member of the group, a middle-aged, heavyset man with graying hair, as he turns his head to spit on the ground.

//&quot;Well, it ain&#39;t exactly a vacation, that&#39;s for sure,&quot; says Monty, sitting on a log. &quot;But laying down and drinking fruity cocktails ain&#39;t my idea of a good time either. I work hard, and I play hard.&quot;//

Once the other two tribes arrived, Vincent clears his throat and speaks up again.

$v[&quot;Welcome to Survivor: Inca Legacy! The eighteen of you are about to begin the adventure of a lifetime.&quot;] Vincent looks over the cast briefly before looking one of them in the eyes. $v[&quot;Man in the sports jersey, what&#39;s your name?]

&quot;Jarrett,&quot; responds a young man with black hair and a dark complexion. He is sporting a red, blue, and white basketball jersey.

$v[&quot;You haven&#39;t had the opportunity to talk to your tribe yet, but are you already getting impressions from them, and maybe some of those around you?&quot;]

&quot;In a way,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;We&#39;ve been in a helicopter for a little while, so mostly it&#39;s just been seeing each other looking each other over. In my mind at least, the only thing I&#39;ve gotten is that everyone is as interested in finding out what makes me tick as much as I want to know what makes them tick.&quot;

$v[&quot;Interesting,&quot;] says Vincent with a smile. $v[&quot;You, woman in the light blue shirt, what&#39;s your name?&quot;]

&quot;Lisa.&quot;

$v[&quot;Have you had any more luck than Jarrett?&quot;] A few contestants chuckled at this.

&quot;Well, to me it looks like we have an intriguing group,&quot; says Lisa with a bit of a blush, &quot;and I look forward to the pleasure of acquainting myself with them all!&quot;

$v[&quot;Well, Lisa, here&#39;s your first chance to see how you and your tribe will get along.&quot;] Vincent holds three slips of paper in his hand, and he waves them in front of him. $v[&quot;In my hand are notes containing clues to all three hidden immunity idols, as well as a clue to another secret advantage. Each tribe will get one to share... unless they choose to give it up for something that can help them in another way.&quot;] He steps to the side, revealing three rolled-up tarps. One is a purple colour, one is green, and one is white. $v[&quot;You can choose to give up this note in exchange for a tarp. It may not help you strategically, but this will keep you warm and dry at night, and it might protect your tribe so you&#39;ll never even need these clues. Now, you all have a few minutes to discuss with your tribe whether you want the note or the tarp.&quot;]

A young woman with brown hair brushed to one side and wearing a denim jacket steps forward off the light pink mat. &quot;We&#39;re going to take the tarp.&quot;

Vincent raises his eyebrows, watching the other two tribes huddle out of the corner of his eye. $v[&quot;Sorry, what&#39;s your name?&quot;]

&quot;My name&#39;s Jennifer,&quot; she replies.

$v[&quot;Are you sure you want to speak for your tribe on this?&quot;]

Jennifer nods. &quot;A tarp will help all of us, an idol will only help one of us and lead to division in our tribe. We need the tarp.&quot;

Vincent passes the white tarp over to Jennifer. $v[&quot;Jennifer, you and the five people behind you are now the] $c[Chalpe Tribe]$v[. Your tarp comes with a map to your camp, and a small kit of the necessities needed to start off strong.&quot;]

After a brief discussion, Jarrett steps off the green mat. &quot;We&#39;re going to take the tarp. We can all use the tarp, we can&#39;t all use the idol.&quot;

Behind him, an anthropomorphic skunk wearing a leather jacket speaks up. &quot;Dude, Jennifer literally just said that.&quot;

$v[&quot;Regardless,&quot;] says Vincent, $v[&quot;Jarrett, you and your five teammates are now the] $o[Ochora Tribe]$v[. You will start off with the same supplies as Chalpe.&quot;] He passes the green tarp over to Jarrett.

After a much longer debate, eventually a college-aged woman with bronze-coloured skin and dark brown hair steps off the indigo mat. &quot;Vincent, we&#39;re going to take the tarp as well.&quot;

$v[&quot;Alright, what&#39;s your name?&quot;] Vincent asks.

&quot;Paula,&quot; she replies.

$v[&quot;Paula, so you are also taking the tarp. May I ask why?&quot;]

&quot;Because anyone who wants to take the clue is going to incur the suspicion of our entire tribe, so we want to take away that temptation.&quot;

Behind her, a woman of the same age with bright blonde hair and a red and black plaid jacket shakes her head.

$v[&quot;Plaid jacket woman, is there something wrong?&quot;] Vincent asks.

&quot;I just don&#39;t think that&#39;s true,&quot; she replies. &quot;The whole tribe can use an idol if we stick together. And if we make a good enough shelter we don&#39;t need a tarp.&quot;

&quot;I really don&#39;t think your scenario is likely,&quot; says Monty.

&quot;Well, don&#39;t come crying to me if you guys are outnumbered at the merge.&quot;

Vincent passes the purple tarp to Paula. $v[&quot;Well, time to see whether your prediction comes true. You guys are the ]$q[Quibas Tribe]$v[. And now that you all have the tarps, your decision has been locked in.&quot;] He rips up the three notes. $v[&quot;You can now head off to your new home. Best of luck.&quot;]

$c[**Chalpe**]

The six members of the tribe arrive at their tribe camp. Jennifer is leading the way, holding the map, having relegated the tribe map to someone else. Their camp is an open field with short grass on a gentle slope. They have a well, but no open water in sight.

&quot;Well, we&#39;re here,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;Any objections to me taking charge so we can get this tribe rolling?&quot;

Nobody says anything.

&quot;Alright.&quot; Jennifer folds up the map and tucks it into her bag. &quot;I don&#39;t really see any of us being all-stars in the strength department, so I think we should all pitch in for building the shelter.&quot;

//&quot;Leadership is in my blood,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;But to come out and say &#39;hi, I&#39;m Jennifer, here to boss you all around&#39; would be a death sentence. So, I gotta be careful with my word choice. I need to be approachable if I want to succeed.&quot;//

&quot;We should split up so we can look for supplies in more places, though,&quot; says a man with shoulder-length dirty blond hair and a purple and blue plaid jacket.

&quot;Good idea,&quot; Jennifer replies. &quot;I&#39;ll go this way, you go that way, the rest of you just follow one of us.&quot;

&quot;Just stick to the trails, you don&#39;t know what&#39;s lurking out here,&quot; adds the plaid-shirted man.

//&quot;We may be in the jungles, but it&#39;s not always the wild that you have to worry about,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;Sometimes the biggest dangers are hiding in human skin. ...That sounded less creepy in my head. I mean watch your back, not watch out for the wendigo.&quot;//

Rhett and Lisa walk down one path alongside a college-aged man with short blond hair and a gray and blue t-shirt.

&quot;I am positively elated to be out here,&quot; Lisa explains cheerfully. &quot;I do believe we will be having a splendid time out here, but I would love to know more about you gentlemen.&quot;

&quot;R-really?&quot; The gray-shirted man asks quietly.

&quot;You don&#39;t have anything to hide, do you?&quot; Rhett asks, raising an eyebrow.

&quot;I don&#39;t, I swear! I just don&#39;t like being put on the spot.&quot;

//&quot;In general, I don&#39;t like people I don&#39;t know,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;I&#39;ve been told I come off as confrontational at times, but I see it as making it clear that my trust needs to be earned. The sooner my tribe realizes I&#39;m not going to bend over backwards for them, the better we can all get along.&quot;//

&quot;I&#39;m a medicine student,&quot; Buddy explains. &quot;I would like to be a doctor someday. Maybe a physician or a surgeon.&quot;

&quot;Aw, that is so wonderful!&quot; says Lisa. &quot;You will touch the hearts of thousands. What about you, Rhett?&quot;

Rhett coughs into his fist. &quot;I don&#39;t like to discuss my personal life in front of the cameras.&quot;

Buddy rolls his eyes. &quot;Where do you think you are? This is reality television, they&#39;re going to hear everything. Didn&#39;t you sign a release form?&quot;

&quot;I forged my signature,&quot; Rhett replies.

&quot;How do you forge your //own// signature?&quot; Buddy asks in disbelief.

Rhett cuts Buddy off. &quot;Lisa, how about you? What do you do?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just a normal girl with big dreams,&quot; Lisa replies. &quot;I&#39;m here to play for my family. Right before I left, my dear father was in a messy car accident... I didn&#39;t get to say goodbye.&quot; She clenches her eyes shut, and says softly, &quot;I&#39;m playing this for my dad.&quot;

&quot;Lisa, I&#39;m... I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;We&#39;re here for you if you need anything, alright?&quot;

//&quot;I&#39;m pleased that we have Buddy, bless his soul, on our tribe,&quot; says Lisa. &quot;I didn&#39;t even have the heart to interrupt him and tell him my dear father is alive and well. He only could not arrive at the airport to wish me well before the plane took off.&quot;//

On the other side, Jennifer is walking with Denine, as well as with a chubby anthropomorphic otter with brown fur, an open blue jacket, and a black and white cap.

&quot;So, I&#39;m one of the rare few that actually appreciates all of the seasons in some way,&quot; says Denine. &quot;Obviously some are better than others, but I don&#39;t think any of them are actually terrible.&quot;

&quot;Wow, not even ---?&quot; Jennifer asks, with the season she believes as terrible being censored.

&quot;Yeah that one sucked,&quot; adds the otter.

&quot;Maybe I&#39;m just a bit of a sadist who likes seeing people miserable.&quot; Denine giggles.

The otter&#39;s eyes widen.

//&quot;I like Denine&#39;s brutal honesty,&quot; says Louie. &quot;She&#39;s determined, and despite her positive demeanour, it doesn&#39;t look like she is going to put up with any crap.&quot;//

&quot;As long as I come out with the million, what happens in between doesn&#39;t really matter,&quot; says Louie. &quot;And if it means crushing some dreams I&#39;ll do it.&quot;

&quot;Well you aren&#39;t going to crush any of mine,&quot; says Denine. &quot;I&#39;m not going down without a fight.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want to see you go down without a fight,&quot; Louie replies.

&quot;Scratch that, I&#39;m not going down.&quot; Denine smirks.

&quot;Nice to see you&#39;re hyped and all,&quot; says Jennifer, &quot;but I hope the two of you can save this for when we have to beat the other tribes.&quot;

Denine nods. &quot;Absolutely. We&#39;re going to crush them.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t make promises you can&#39;t keep,&quot; says Louie.

&quot;I&#39;ll keep that in mind for when I make one,&quot; Denine fires back.

//&quot;Morale is high, we&#39;re working as a team, I&#39;d say we&#39;re doing pretty well,&quot; says Denine. &quot;It&#39;s not going to be this easy, but if you start strong then it&#39;s all the more likely you can finish strong.&quot;//

$o[**Ochora**]

The tribe of six arrives at their new camp. Their camp consists of a plateau atop a small hill. A stream runs along one edge of the camp, and mutiple paths lead away from the camp and the stream. A black-haired woman of Korean descent with glasses and a yellow shirt is holding the map.

&quot;Congratulations, we&#39;ve made it here alive,&quot; she says. &quot;We need to get a shelter built and food collected, since we don&#39;t have flint right now.&quot;

//&quot;We have a tarp, that&#39;s a huge advantage right out of the gate,&quot; says Min-Ji. &quot;We need to make sure we don&#39;t blow it.&quot;//

The tribe divides into two groups. In one group, Ashleia is looking for food, and she is followed by a blonde woman with tan skin and a blue sweater, and a pale blond man with a pair of soft, pastel blue wings.

&quot;So, like, your names are Candace and Saul, right?&quot; Ashleia smiles. &quot;I&#39;m good with names, so I&#39;ll take note of that.&quot;

Saul nods. &quot;Okay, so do you know what we should be doing right now?&quot; he asks.

Ashleia sadly shakes her head. &quot;I know that, like, we should find fruit and stuff since we aren&#39;t eating just rice? But I don&#39;t really know what grows around here. I&#39;m not used to buying fruit that isn&#39;t pre-washed.&quot;

&quot;Have you ever actually seen a fruit outside of the supermarket?&quot; Candace asks.

&quot;Like, of course!&quot; Ashleia responds. &quot;That&#39;s what the kitchen is for!&quot;

//&quot;I&#39;m a bit worried that Ashleia isn&#39;t all there in the head,&quot; says Candace. &quot;Do you know where you are right now? Do you understand the conditions you&#39;re going to be living in? How many fingers am I holding up?&quot;//

Saul looks at a berry bush with a raised eyebrow. &quot;I am wondering if these here are edible.&quot;

&quot;They, like, should be or they wouldn&#39;t be out here, right?&quot; Ashleia asks.

Saul glances over at Ashleia, with a horrified expression on his face.

&quot;What?&quot;

Candace walks over and plucks a berry from the bush. &quot;Hm… it&#39;s interesting. Reminds me of our planet. Blue, round, soft, delicate to the touch. It may heal us or harm us, and we can only discover this by taking it all in.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t understand,&quot; Saul replies.

&quot;We have to eat it to know if it&#39;s safe,&quot; says Candace.

&quot;That might not be the best course of action,&quot; Saul whispers. Candace ignores him and eats the berry.

&quot;How was it?&quot; Ashleia asks.

&quot;It was okay,&quot; says Candace. &quot;If we don&#39;t see the medical team in the next six hours, then they should be fine, right?&quot;

//&quot;I had my first vision of the game while spending time with the blonde girls,&quot; says Saul. &quot;They can be vague, but I try my best to interpret them, so I can use them to help others. Unfortunately, I could only see Candace crouched over a bush in this vision. I hope she has something to use to hold her hair back…&quot;// 

Elsewhere, the rest of the tribe is collecting supplies for building the shelter. Min-Ji is clearing the way with the tribe&#39;s machete, getting the other guys to do most of the carrying.

&quot;Think we have enough for six, now?&quot; Jarrett asks, carrying several logs.
Min-Ji looks at the pile in Jarrett&#39;s arms, and nods. &quot;Between you and Rocky, we definitely have enough. If we find anything on the way back, I&#39;ll take it.&quot;

&quot;Then let&#39;s get a move on,&quot; says Rocky. The skunk gently jerks his head downwards, causing the sunglasses on his head to fall into place over his eyes.

//&quot;Everything&#39;s coming together just the way I wanted it,&quot; Rocky says, flashing a toothy smile. &quot;I&#39;m working on making a good impression with the people on my tribe who look like they&#39;ll be pulling their own weight. I&#39;m not really here for dragging along people who can&#39;t keep up, you see.&quot;//

&quot;So, while we&#39;re away from the others,&quot; Min-Ji asks, &quot;what do you think of the three out picking fruit?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t really think the one in the pink dress is all that savvy,&quot; Jarrett replies. &quot;She seems out of her element.&quot;

&quot;All three of them seem kind of… passive, if you ask me,&quot; Min-Ji adds. &quot;I&#39;m hoping that they&#39;re just nervous since it&#39;s day one. Eventually we all need to get with the program.&quot;

&quot;But if they don&#39;t, then that&#39;s three fewer to worry about.&quot; Rocky chuckles. &quot;We can bin &#39;em like dirty laundry.&quot;

Min-Ji visibly winces at Rocky&#39;s lack of respect. &quot;…right. At least Candace seems to have a decent build, she might be able to help in the strength department.&quot;

Jarrett nods. &quot;We need to minimize losses. We can&#39;t afford to lose more than one person.&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Min-Ji replies. &quot;We don&#39;t want to get targeted after the swap for being intact, though. So, we need to just make sure we don&#39;t start on the wrong foot.&quot;

&quot;Then let&#39;s hope we get a good first challenge.&quot;

//&quot;Min-Ji is fairly bright, I can tell that just by listening to her talk,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;Early game, I think her support is worth having. She seems eager to take on a sort of leadership role as well. I&#39;m willing to back her up there, if only because I don&#39;t want to do that myself.&quot;//

The trio arrives back at camp with their shelter building supplies, and places them down before realizing the others aren&#39;t back yet.

Rocky shrugs. &quot;We might as well get started with the shelter before the others come back.&quot;

Jarrett looks over at Min-Ji. &quot;Where did you put the tarp, by the way?&quot;

Min-Ji gestures to a flat area of the camp, next to some bushes. &quot;Over there, where the shelter should go if you ask me.&quot;

Jarrett nods. &quot;Sounds like a plan.&quot;

//&quot;I think I clicked with Jarrett,&quot; Min-Ji admits. She adjusts her glasses. &quot;The two of us are on the same page as to what we want to do. He&#39;s easy to talk to, and I already feel like we&#39;re going to work well together.&quot;//

$q[**Quibas**]

Paula is climbing up a tree to try and get a better vantage point. &quot;I don&#39;t see anything else up here,&quot; she calls down to her tribemate.

&quot;It was worth a shot,&quot; her tribemate replies, brushing her blonde hair out of her face. Her plaid jacket is wrapped around her waist, revealing a light gray undershirt. &quot;We might have enough for a day or two.&quot;

//Jackie holds her knees with her hands as she leans forward. &quot;Paula and I went to go get some fruit for the tribe, since we were unsure about how long our rice would last. So, I did what any good Survivor player would do and started hinting at working together.&quot;//

&quot;You and me, final two, what do you think?&quot; Jackie asks.

Paula raises her eyebrows. &quot;Already?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I have the perfect plan,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;First we get rid of Monty for being old and therefore weak. Then the purple hood guy, he looks shady. Then we have a girl&#39;s alliance with the rabbit but we turn on her because she can&#39;t help us win immunity. Then we go with the guy with the glasses to the final four, then take him out and whoever&#39;s left. It&#39;s literally foolproof.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s… a lot to process,&quot; Paula replies. &quot;I&#39;ll need a few days to think about this. But in the meantime, you never told me what you do outside the game. Are you a student, are you working, or what?&quot;

&quot;Come on, Paula,&quot; says Jackie flippantly, &quot;we both know you don&#39;t really care.&quot;

&quot;I mean, I would like to get to know someone before I agree to be their final two partner,&quot; says Paula.

&quot;Whatever. Sooner or later, I&#39;m going to need a yes or a no.&quot;

//&quot;I thought this was a social experiment, emphasis on social,&quot; says Paula. &quot;Is it wrong for me to want to think this over? Or is Jackie just playing too hard and looking like an idiot?&quot;//

Monty has recruited another tribe member – a young man with brown hair, glasses, and a five o&#39;clock shadow – to help him build the shelter. They have selected the highest part of their camp to build the shelter and fire pit, knowing the steep hill leading down to a shallow and small lake would be too troublesome to build on.

&quot;You sure you&#39;re a construction worker? I can trust you that this will be stable?&quot; Monty&#39;s new acquaintance asks.

&quot;No reason to lie,&quot; says Monty. &quot;What&#39;s your name again?&quot;

&quot;Vaclav,&quot; replies the younger man.

&quot;Oh,&quot; says Monty. &quot;Sorry. I&#39;m no good with foreign names. Can I call you something like V-Man?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d rather you not,&quot; says Vaclav.

&quot;Okay, V,&quot; Monty replies. He straightens out the tribe&#39;s purple tarp and stretches it over the shelter roof.

//&quot;I don&#39;t even know how I&#39;m supposed to spell that,&quot; says Monty in his thick Southern drawl. &quot;V-A-T-Z-L-O-V? I ain&#39;t got an idea. I don&#39;t speak any European languages.&quot;//

The two tie the tarp on, and then decide to explore around the camp a little. While walking, Vaclav turns to Monty cautiously.

&quot;I-I just think you should know that I&#39;m kind of scared to be out here,&quot; Vaclav sheepishly admits. &quot;Everything here is kind of new to me. Tropical weather, no running water, the whole game component, you know? I&#39;m freaking out internally.&quot;

&quot;You got nothing to worry about in my book,&quot; Monty reassures him. &quot;You&#39;re a strong guy, you should be safe for a while.&quot;

&quot;Please don&#39;t vote me out! I&#39;m not a physical threat!&quot; Vaclav pleads.

&quot;Why would I ever do that, Vad-man?&quot; Monty wonders aloud. &quot;You seem like a good kid. Ease up a bit.&quot; He spits into a rut in the dirt path.

The two continue down a path away from camp. Meanwhile, their other two tribemates are busy assembling a fire pit. One of them, an anthropomorphic rabbit girl, gestures towards the indigo hood being worn by the other.

&quot;So, what&#39;s this for? Are you a druid or something?&quot; she asks.

&quot;Close, but not quite. I&#39;m a ninja.&quot;

&quot;How are ninjas and druids related?&quot;

//Tara scratches her head, right behind one of her long floppy ears. &quot;So the hooded guy, Khall, I kind of got drawn to him because I feel like I&#39;m dwarfed around everyone else besides maybe Paula. I felt more comfortable with him at first. But now I&#39;m learning he&#39;s kind of… weird.&quot;//

&quot;…and then the entire ride came to a screeching halt! I got out of my seat and raced over to see what the problem was,&quot; says Khall.

&quot;Okay, were you allowed to?&quot; Tara asks.

&quot;I don&#39;t remember, but that might be why I ran into those security guards later,&quot; Khall replies. &quot;But anyways. I got right under the nose of the car, and would you believe it – stuck under the left wheel, it was the five of spades!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s actually kind of cool,&quot; says Tara. She smiles. &quot;You know, magic is kind of my thing. I don&#39;t usually do card tricks and stuff though, I get more… advanced than that.&quot;

&quot;Oh, awesome! What am I thinking about right now?&quot; Khall excitedly asks.

&quot;You&#39;re thinking about what I mean by advanced tricks,&quot; Tara replies, a little confused.

&quot;Wow, that&#39;s amazing! How did you know?&quot;

//&quot;I love Tara! She&#39;s like my best friend here,&quot; Khall explains. &quot;We&#39;re both good at bending the fabric of reality, and we both like the colour green! It&#39;s great to be on her tribe, and working with her would be amazing.&quot;//

&quot;Want to see something I can do?&quot; Tara asks. She lifts one paw about five centimeters above a rock. She then raises her paw slowly in the air, and to Khall&#39;s surprise, the rock moves up at the same rate.

&quot;What else can you do? Oh, can you make it into a cactus?&quot; Khall suggests.

Tara&#39;s concentration breaks, and the rock drops back to the ground. &quot;W-what!? I&#39;m sorry, I guess I just didn&#39;t expect you to ask something like that.&quot;

Khall looks down sadly.

&quot;I just can&#39;t make something alive out of something not alive is all,&quot; says Tara. &quot;I mean you&#39;d have to give me some other kind of plant for me to do that.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be right back!&quot; Khall exclaims.

&quot;Oh, no you don&#39;t! We have a fire pit to make still,&quot; says Tara, grabbing onto his green cape. Khall stumbles and falls backwards when he fails to break out of Tara&#39;s grip.

//&quot;I can&#39;t really deny that at the same time Khall seems like a genuine guy, if a little loopy,&quot; says Tara. &quot;And I think I need to start working on getting my head in the game, so maybe working with him wouldn&#39;t be a bad place to start.&quot;//

Tara opens her mouth to ask a question, but Khall places his gloved hand over her mouth.

&quot;I don&#39;t see a problem with voting with you,&quot; says Khall, &quot;but my creator had a character win the last season, so I doubt I&#39;ll be around to help you for very long.&quot;

Tara pushes Khall&#39;s arm back. &quot;I don&#39;t even understand what you&#39;re trying to say here.&quot;

At this point, Monty and Vaclav return to camp. Monty is holding a piece of flint.

&quot;We can get fire now,&quot; says Monty. &quot;Either of you get any leaves or twigs we can start one with?&quot;

&quot;Awesome! Yeah, we have a pile started here. Not sure where the machete went, though,&quot; Tara replies.

//&quot;I didn&#39;t think getting the flint would be that easy,&quot; Vaclav admits, &quot;but it turns out not far from camp was this little place with a bunch of podiums and tribe banners, and there were three pieces of flint. I thought we would need to earn it, but heh, maybe not. I might have to go back and make sure we didn&#39;t miss anything. No stone unturned... or else...&quot; He shudders.//

$c[**Chalpe**]

//&quot;Well, we ran out of time to construct a fire pit,&quot; says Lisa, &quot;but we do have quite the pleasant little abode with a nice white tarp on top! If it rains, fire might not be so urgent, I suppose.&quot;//

Louie was the first to wake up, after having turned in early last night. He tries to sit himself up, but finds more than his overweight frame holding him down. He looks down and notices all five members of his tribe are using his chest and belly as a pillow.

&quot;Get. Off. Me.&quot; He growls, but his plea falls on deaf ears, as nobody stirs to hear him. He sighs.

//&quot;Who needs comfort items when you have Louie?&quot; Buddy chuckles to himself. &quot;Although I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s worth the crotchety old man vibe we all get when he&#39;s awake. So I&#39;m guessing I should enjoy it while he&#39;s still able to resist just pushing us off.&quot;//

Louie&#39;s stomach abruptly rumbles, which quickly makes the other five awaken.

&quot;What the hell was that?&quot; Denine grumbles, wiping her eyes.

&quot;Your warning that if we don&#39;t get some food in the next, I don&#39;t know, two hours, you&#39;re all on my hit list,&quot; Louie replies.

//&quot;No fire so we can&#39;t cook the rice. Nobody bothered to go look for fruit yesterday. You bet I&#39;m pissed,&quot; Louie explains. &quot;I&#39;m not a happy-go-lucky guy, understand? I&#39;m not going to fake a smile just for brownie points with these people.&quot;//

Jennifer and Buddy go off on their own first.

&quot;Alright, so we need to have a good variety of fruits and seeds,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;If we just have a bunch of fruits then we have no protein, and we can&#39;t live on seeds because we aren&#39;t chipmunks.&quot;

&quot;Louie kind of looks like one,&quot; says Buddy.

&quot;One, he&#39;s an otter,&quot; Jennifer replies, &quot;and two, this food is just for the five of us. I bet he can get his own food.&quot;

&quot;And if he can&#39;t, he can stand to go on an emergency diet,&quot; says Buddy.

&quot;Scan the left side of the path for anything that looks edible,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;I&#39;ll handle the right. We can sort it out back at camp and see what won&#39;t poison us.&quot;

//&quot;We&#39;re done with the greetings and the gossip, time to worry about survival,&quot; explains Jennifer. &quot;This tribe I can already tell has either a discipline problem or a superiority complex. If we&#39;re going to be successful, that can&#39;t stand.&quot;//

Buddy looks over at Jennifer. &quot;Do you think this is enough?&quot; He is lifting the bottom of his shirt, so he can hold a sizable amount of berries and seeds in the pocket he has created over his stomach.

&quot;Did you seriously forget to bring a basket?&quot; Jennifer asks, with an eyebrow raised.

&quot;You didn&#39;t give me much time to think about what was going on,&quot; Buddy replies.

Jennifer rolls her eyes. &quot;Just... just put it in mine. It should fit.&quot;

//&quot;Hey, Jen, here&#39;s a tip for you,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;Chill out with the whole power trip stuff. It&#39;s just making me not want to have to listen to your barking orders.&quot;//

Meanwhile, Denine and Rhett are walking together. Denine is walking slightly in front of Rhett, carrying the basket that Buddy forgot.

&quot;You know, I like a guy who&#39;s good with his hands,&quot; says Denine. She raises an eyebrow and smiles.

&quot;I like a girl who knows there&#39;s a time and a place for hookups,&quot; Rhett replies.

&quot;Touché,&quot; Denine says, &quot;but it was worth a shot.&quot;

//&quot;I can&#39;t help that Rhett&#39;s cute, you know,&quot; says Denine. &quot;I didn&#39;t expect to only have two guys I could really try with. I thought I could give Rhett a shot, but I guess I need to win him over the old-fashioned way – small talk.&quot;//

&quot;So what do you like most about Survivor?&quot; Denine excitedly asks.

&quot;I like the concept of many bright minds coming together and putting each other to the test,&quot; Rhett explains. &quot;It&#39;s a bit of a tragedy that it has so often been diluted to the benefit of the more physically fit males, to the detriment of the other players.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, production rigging sucks, but it&#39;s led to some good moments,&quot; Denine replies.

&quot;Production... rigging? They can do that?&quot; Rhett asks, slightly worried.

&quot;Sometimes,&quot; says Denine. &quot;Reality TV is a misnomer.&quot;

&quot;Interesting.&quot; Rhett picks a fruit from a tree, and places it in Denine&#39;s basket. &quot;So, I have a philosophical question for you.&quot;

&quot;Okay, shoot.&quot;

&quot;Do you believe someone can be held responsible for what they do while they are inebriated?&quot; Rhett asks.

Denine, while a little confused, decides to give her honest opinion. &quot;I think so, if they made the decision to consume alcohol. Isn&#39;t that more of a legal question, though?&quot;

&quot;Well, alcohol does remove inhibitions often, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; Rhett replies. &quot;Their actions may reflect what they want to do while sober.&quot;

//&quot;I am pleased to see that Denine was not casted for her looks,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;I think she makes a good debate partner, and I believe she may be a useful ally as well.&quot;//

Lisa is back at camp, keeping an eye on Louie.

&quot;Do not fret, my rotund companion,&quot; says Lisa. &quot;Our tribe is hard at work finding food for us all. Oh, perhaps we could have a soiree to celebrate! That would lift our spirits for the first challenge, I bet. And aren&#39;t they simply delightful occasions?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll pass,&quot; says Louie flatly.

&quot;Oh, Louie, don&#39;t be such a sourpuss!&quot; Lisa replies. &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll enjoy it, even if our company leaves a little to be desired.&quot;

Louie pulls his visor over his eyes.

&quot;Oh, dearie! Are you feeling alright?&quot; Lisa asks. &quot;You aren&#39;t having a migraine, are you?&quot;

&quot;Shut up,&quot; Louie snaps.

//&quot;I&#39;m feeling a bit miffed that Louie is shutting us all out like this,&quot; Lisa admits. &quot;And although I would love to have him in brighter spirits, if he does not open up then eliminating him would not be a hassle.&quot;//

$o[**Ochora**]

Min-Ji is walking by herself, trying to get a little alone time to think.

//&quot;Our tribe is doing okay,&quot; she explains. &quot;We are all getting along, and we don&#39;t have anyone who&#39;s difficult to talk to, save for Rocky. But he&#39;s our sacrificial lamb, so we have five good people who can work together.&quot;//

On her walk, she stumbles across a quaint plaza of sorts. She notices three wide podiums, each bearing a tribe colour. The $o[green] and $c[light pink] podiums each have flint on top, while the $q[indigo] podium has nothing. She walks past the row of eighteen torches at the other side of the plaza and inspects the area.

&quot;This must be the twist,&quot; says Min-Ji. &quot;Some sort of meeting place, I can imagine.&quot; She then notices a small sign near the podiums and decides to read what it says out loud.

&quot;Not all great empires can rule from one throne. The Inca empire was divided into four separate kingdoms, but cooperation between them was vital. In the same way, the **Town Square** has been provided to you to mingle with the other tribes.&quot;

//&quot;Right when I thought everything was going well, here comes a curveball,&quot; says Min-Ji. She sighs. &quot;The problem is, what use is this twist when we don&#39;t have any allies on the other side? Should I tell the others about this?&quot;//

Min-Ji eventually decides to leave the flint where it is and return to camp.

//&quot;I couldn&#39;t risk it. It&#39;s a little too early. We need to focus on ourselves first, and as long as it stays dry we might not need the flint quite yet. Knock on wood.&quot;//

Back at camp, Jarrett is chatting with Ashleia and Candace.

&quot;So, has Min-Ji talked to either of you guys about tribe leadership or anything like that?&quot; Jarrett asks.

&quot;Anyone may be appointed a leader,&quot; says Candace, &quot;but true leadership comes from within. She must ask herself if she wants to be a true guide, or merely a tyrant.&quot;

Jarrett raises an eyebrow.

&quot;Um, I guess that wasn&#39;t a good berry,&quot; says Ashleia.

&quot;The berry was fine,&quot; Candace assures her. &quot;Besides, Rocky already ate like twelve and he&#39;s still conscious.&quot;

//&quot;I consider myself someone who&#39;s in touch with the world,&quot; explains Candace. &quot;I do feel like sometimes I have to pour my soul out, in the hopes that I can help others obtain a sort of... nirvana. It&#39;s a sort of inner poetry.&quot;//

&quot;I mean, I think she could be leader if she wants to,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;She hasn&#39;t really done anything wrong yet.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s my reasoning as well,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;Candace, anything to add?&quot;

&quot;Not especially,&quot; says Candace. &quot;Kind of distracted at the moment.&quot;

&quot;What did I just say?&quot; Jarrett asks.

&quot;Candace, anything to add?&quot; Candace replies.

//&quot;I thought Ashleia was going to be the difficult one to work with,&quot; Jarrett explains, &quot;but Candace is on another level. She&#39;s letting the game just flow around her. She needs to get serious.&quot;//

Ashleia manages to get Jarrett alone afterwards for a one-on-one talk.

&quot;Okay, Jarret, like, I think you know what you&#39;re doing and all,&quot; Ashleia explains. &quot;Can we maybe, like, work together for now? I just don&#39;t want to be left out because of, like, first impressions and stuff. I know I can help you, I&#39;m not an idiot.&quot;

Jarrett pretends to think it over for a few seconds, before nodding. &quot;Alright, sounds good to me. We can team up.&quot;

&quot;Thank you so much,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;This is, like, something I promise you won&#39;t regret!&quot;

//&quot;I&#39;m, like, not really used to working with men. I don&#39;t have the best history with them since a lot of them see me, like, as less of a person just because I&#39;m pretty and stuff,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;But, like, here I&#39;m going out on a limb and talking to Jarrett because I don&#39;t have much choice. I hope it, like, works out.&quot;//

Min-Ji arrives back at camp to notice Saul struggling with making a fire, and Rocky sitting nearby watching. Saul is trying his hardest to rub two sticks together.

&quot;Just give up, it&#39;s not happening,&quot; says Rocky.

&quot;I want to help this tribe, and in the absence of flint, this is my preferred course of action,&quot; Saul replies.

&quot;Pfft, you&#39;re just tiring yourself out.&quot; Rocky leans forward. &quot;Those sticks are bigger than your forearms, you&#39;re not getting any kind of friction here.&quot;

&quot;Would you like to try?&quot; Saul asks.

&quot;What do you think I was doing for the past three hours?&quot; Rocky counters.

&quot;Air guitar,&quot; says Saul.

//&quot;I sense an unpleasant aura from Rocky, and he makes little effort to mask it,&quot; Saul explains. &quot;It is one of arrogance, entitlement, and associated behaviours. I am doing what I can to counteract this, for the good of the tribe.&quot;//

&quot;Rocky, lay off him, at least he&#39;s trying,&quot; says Min-Ji.

&quot;It&#39;s no use unless we have flint,&quot; Rocky replies. &quot;It&#39;s not my fault he&#39;s using up his strength on a lost cause.&quot;

&quot;I wish we had flint too,&quot; says Min-Ji. &quot;But life doesn&#39;t always work like that. Suck it up, kid.&quot;

//&quot;What did I even do to her?&quot; Rocky asks. &quot;Heck, what did I do to anyone!? I&#39;ve just been trying to help out and make sure we don&#39;t waste our energy.&quot;//

$q[**Quibas**]

Monty and Paula are crouched by the lakeshore, collecting water to boil.

&quot;So we&#39;re supposedly that close to the other camps? And they didn&#39;t tell us about this at the start?&quot; Paula makes a concerned hum. &quot;What an odd way to treat a game changing twist.&quot;

&quot;It ain&#39;t no big deal,&quot; Monty replies. &quot;Just a twist is all.&quot;

&quot;You know what this reminds me of?&quot; Paula says, standing up. &quot;Not sure why I thought of this. But walking through the woods behind my house. I live at the edge of a small forestry town, and there&#39;s this neat little campground not too far a walk from the backyard. It&#39;s where I used to chill with my friends in my elementary years, before we knew about vodka coolers.&quot; She chuckles.

&quot;No way, you&#39;re from the country too?&quot; Monty smiles. &quot;Well, I didn&#39;t expect that from someone so... so...&quot;

&quot;Just say it,&quot; Paula teases.

&quot;Hispanic.&quot;

&quot;W-HUH?&quot;

&quot;Oh, um, is that not the word you use anymore?&quot; Monty asks.

&quot;What does that have to do with me living in the country!?&quot; Paula replies.

//&quot;Good going, you dolt,&quot; says Monty. &quot;You made the girl uncomfortable. I gotta make it up to Paula, this ain&#39;t how I wanted to start things with her.&quot;//

&quot;I thought y&#39;all lived in cities or something, my bad,&quot; says Monty sheepishly.

&quot;I suggest you keep quiet for a while, so you don&#39;t dig yourself deeper,&quot; Paula replies.

&quot;That&#39;s a good idea,&quot; Monty mumbles.

&quot;I hope you haven&#39;t been saying that kind of stuff to anyone else,&quot; says Paula. &quot;Is that way Jackie wants to vote you out?&quot;

Monty raises an eyebrow. &quot;I barely even talked to her. But that ain&#39;t no problem to me. We can sort that out if we lose, you know?&quot;

//&quot;I don&#39;t think he meant to do that,&quot; says Paula. &quot;So, I decided to give him another chance, and even tip him off about Jackie because she&#39;s being kind of a game-obsessed psycho. I would love to have time to get my bearings, so having those two against each other isn&#39;t the worst thing in the world I suppose.&quot;//

The pair returns to camp, where Khall and Jackie are sitting.

&quot;Wow, we sure got a lot of water to boil so we don&#39;t go thirsty,&quot; Monty says loudly. &quot;It feels great to help out the tribe.&quot;

&quot;Um, yeah, I guess,&quot; Paula replies.

Monty walks over to Khall. &quot;Hey Khall,&quot; he says, so Jackie will hear him, &quot;don&#39;t you think it&#39;s great that we&#39;re doing all this work around camp?&quot;

Jackie scowls.

//&quot;Oh you&#39;ve got to be kidding,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;He does ONE thing good, and he wants to rub it in our faces. Newsflash, anyone can do that!&quot;//

Jackie then pulls Tara aside. &quot;Tara, listen, we need to be in an alliance.&quot;

&quot;Why do you say that?&quot; Tara asks.

&quot;Paula must have told Monty that I want him out, so now she&#39;s kind of against us. We need to stick together and bring in Khall and Vaclav, so we have the majority,&quot; Jackie replies quickly.

&quot;Let&#39;s not be too hasty,&quot; says Tara.

&quot;Do you want the game to pass you by?&quot; Jackie asks. &quot;Or do you want to take control and be respected?&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind working with you, but you don&#39;t have to be so intense,&quot; says Tara.

//&quot;I just don&#39;t want it to be Khall or me,&quot; says Tara. &quot;So if Jackie wants to side with us, that&#39;s good for me, even if she&#39;s, you know, Jackie.&quot;//

&quot;Well, now that we&#39;re allies we need to figure out what we do if we ever lose,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;Like right now anything&#39;s fine with me because everyone else here sucks.&quot;

&quot;I thought you liked Paula,&quot; Tara replies.

&quot;I can&#39;t trust Paula right now,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;If she can&#39;t see that working with Monty is a bad idea, then that&#39;s her problem. You and I, we&#39;re the only ones that matter right now.&quot;

&quot;So, um, can we possibly vote out Vaclav if we lose?&quot; Tara asks. &quot;If you and I are together, and Paula and Monty are, and I can get Khall with us, then he&#39;s kind of the outsider.&quot;

&quot;Um, why him and not Monty?&quot; Jackie asks.

&quot;He just seems like a nervous wreck, and I don&#39;t want him to, you know, tank us by accident,&quot; explains Tara.

//&quot;Monty just... sucks,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;I know he hasn&#39;t really done anything wrong, and he&#39;s been nothing but nice and helpful, and he helped build the shelter and made the fire, but he&#39;s just... he sucks. I want to get rid of him, with or without Tara&#39;s help.&quot;//

Later in the day, Paula has a conversation with Khall and Tara.

&quot;I&#39;ve seen you two sticking together,&quot; says Paula. &quot;Just friends, I take it?&quot;

&quot;Pretty much,&quot; says Khall. &quot;Any reason why you called us here? No wait, you didn&#39;t call us here, it just felt appropriate to say that.&quot;

&quot;Paula, we want you to vote out Vaclav with us,&quot; says Tara. &quot;I&#39;m concerned about him.&quot;

&quot;I can see why, I guess,&quot; says Paula. &quot;He&#39;s always skittish. But Monty&#39;s assured me that he&#39;s fine.&quot;

&quot;We kind of have to,&quot; says Tara. &quot;I think we&#39;re the most stable ones here, so- Khall what are you doing.&quot;

Paula and Tara look over to see Khall making a balloon animal out of a spare glove.

&quot;Right, stable,&quot; says Paula.

&quot;Okay, just us two then, and Khall&#39;s our extra vote,&quot; says Tara.

&quot;That&#39;s more accurate,&quot; says Khall.

//&quot;Gee, I hope this comic relief is working, or else I&#39;m just detracting from a crucial scene,&quot; says Khall.//

&quot;So, if Jackie is voting Monty, then the three of us can control the vote,&quot; says Paula. &quot;I&#39;ll have to think about it.&quot;

&quot;I, um, I was told you guys were talking about me.&quot;

Khall steps to the side to allow Vaclav into the conversation.

&quot;We weren&#39;t,&quot; says Paula. &quot;We&#39;re just talking about the food situation. By the way, have you found anything recently? I came across this one tree thataway, but I didn&#39;t get to see if it was growing anything good.&quot;

&quot;I can check that out for you.&quot; Vaclav nods and walks away, but quietly ducks into a nearby bush when nobody was looking in his direction.

//&quot;You don&#39;t need to be all hush hush when talking about the food!&quot; Vaclav protests. &quot;I wasn&#39;t going to let them get away that easily. I just knew they were plotting to get me out.&quot;//

Tara, however, can sense that Vaclav hadn&#39;t actually left the scene. She smiles playfully and turns to Paula. &quot;So, did Khall tell you I was a magician?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think he did,&quot; says Paula.

&quot;Well, most of it is my ability to turn things into other things,&quot; Tara explains.

&quot;Except into cactuses,&quot; says Khall, crossing his arms. He looked to be pouting, but it was impossible to read facial expressions under the unnatural darkness beneath his hood.

&quot;Moving on. Vaclav kind of reminds me of a skittish little squirrel,&quot; says Tara.

&quot;I don&#39;t like the sound of this,&quot; says Paula.

&quot;Relax, it would be mostly painless,&quot; Tara replies. &quot;But yeah, you get it. Making the body conform to the mind and all.&quot;

&quot;But why would you do something like that?&quot; Khall asks, incredulously.

&quot;I try not to. It may be fun, but it&#39;s not worth it,&quot; says Tara. &quot;Unless I have a good reason.&quot;

&quot;What kind of reason?&quot; Khall asks, scratching his head.

Tara sticks out her tongue. &quot;Wait and see.&quot;

Vaclav&#39;s eyes go wide. He tries to cover his mouth with his hands without rustling the bush.

//&quot;Well I didn&#39;t know that much about Tara,&quot; says Paula with a shrug. &quot;But she seems pleasant and sweet enough that this side of her shouldn&#39;t be worrisome. ...Right?&quot;//

Immunity Challenge**

Everyone competes. First, one member at a time has to go out and untie a bag of puzzle pieces from underneath a buoy in a lake. There are four bags in total. The fifth person will have to solve a puzzle that gives a sixth person the combination to a locked box, with the trick being the combination is made of various letter-like symbols instead of letters, numbers, or shapes. When the sixth person unlocks the box, they will use the machete inside to cut a small rope that will unfurl their tribe&#39;s banner. First tribe to release their tribe&#39;s banner wins fishing gear, and the last tribe to do so will vote someone out.

ORDER:
First bag: $c[Jennifer], $o[Jarrett], $q[Tara]
Second bag: $c[Rhett], $o[Min-Ji], $q[Monty]
Third bag: $c[Denine], $o[Candace], $q[Paula]
Final bag: $c[Louie], $o[Rocky], $q[Vaclav]
Puzzle: $c[Lisa], $o[Saul], $q[Jackie]
Locked box: $c[Buddy], $o[Ashleia], $q[Khall]

Chalpe edges to an early lead as Jennifer has little trouble, while both Jarrett and Tara have trouble in the water
Jennifer retrieves her bag and tags in Rhett, who closes in as his opponents continue to struggle
Tara then retrieves her bag and tags in Monty, just as Rhett and Jarrett find their bags
Rhett and Jarrett tag in Denine and Min-Ji respectively. Min-Ji does better than Jarrett did, but Denine is an experienced swimmer and handily beats Min-Ji to the bags
Denine finds her bag and swims back while Monty continues having issues and Min-Ji panics while trying to make up for lost time
Denine tags in Louie, who is an even faster and more graceful swimmer than Denine
Monty and Min-Ji both manage to find their bags before Louie, and begin the swim back
Louie finds Chalpe&#39;s last bag, and swims back to the beach. He is unable to catch up with Min-Ji, but he delivers the last bag before Monty tags in Paula
Lisa opens up all four bags and gets to work on the puzzle
Candace has trouble holding her breath, allowing Paula to catch up and tag in slightly faster than Candace
Lisa is halfway done her puzzle when Paula tags in Vaclav
Vaclav surprises his tribe by delivering on his promises to not freak out in the water, actually making good time. However, Rocky is a better swimmer and puts Ochora back in second place
Lisa completes her puzzle, and while she doesn&#39;t recognize the symbols, she explains them as clearly as they can to Buddy
Rocky manages to get his bag out with no trouble, but Vaclav - having left his glasses with Jackie - has issues with depth perception in the water
Rocky manages to deliver the last bag, but it&#39;s too late - Buddy manages to unlock the box
Saul begins opening the bags while Buddy takes the machete and lets the $c[Chalpe] banner unfurl
$c[Chalpe wins immunity and fishing supplies!]
Vaclav unties his bag as Saul works on the puzzle, swimming back and delivering the last puzzle bag to Jackie
Jackie quietly gets to work on her puzzle, occasionally looking over at the cool and collected Saul
To Jackie&#39;s surprise, she finishes the puzzle first, and begins telling Khall what symbols she sees.
Saul takes a minute or two after Jackie finished to finish himself, and proceeds to give directions to Ashleia
Jackie gets frustrated with Khall misinterpreting her directions, and repeats herself instead of clarifying for him
Ashleia, meanwhile, asks Saul more specific questions when she&#39;s confused (instead of simply saying she doesn&#39;t understand, like Khall)
Eventually, Ashleia unlocks the box before Jackie and Khall make much progress.
Jackie annoyedly blames the rest of her tribe for sucking as Ashleia unfurls the $o[Ochora] banner
$o[Ochora wins immunity!]
$q[Quibas loses, and will have to vote someone out at tribal council]

$v[Vincent asks the] $q[Quibas] $v[tribe to kidnap one member of the] $c[Chalpe] $v[tribe to join them at Tribal Council. They will have individual immunity and be able to vote.]
The Quibas tribe has no idea who anyone is, so Paula picks Buddy on a whim. Her tribe shrugs and agrees.

$c[Buddy] is given a bottle to open at tribal council, and goes with the $q[Quibas Tribe] back to their camp

$q[**Quibas**]

After the challenge, Jackie decides to get Tara and Khall to have an alliance conversation with her.

&quot;Well, Monty took longer on the challenge than Vaclav did,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;See what I mean? He&#39;s a liability.&quot;

Tara nods. &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll vote for him this round. Khall, are you in?&quot;

Khall shrugs. &quot;Okay.&quot;

&quot;The two of you better not make me regret this,&quot; says Jackie. She crosses her arms.

&quot;Thanks for being so understanding,&quot; Tara replies flatly.

//&quot;Okay, cool, I&#39;ll vote with you, Jackie,&quot; says Tara. &quot;Now can you stop being so hostile? Please? It&#39;s not healthy.&quot;//

Meanwhile Vaclav is frantically pleading to Monty for survival. Again.

&quot;You gotta take her out, Monty!&quot; Vaclav cries, holding onto Monty&#39;s collar. &quot;She wants to turn me into a squirrel! I heard her! She&#39;s got that strange magic!&quot;

&quot;Well, can she do somethin&#39; like that?&quot; asks a confused Monty.

&quot;I don&#39;t want to chance it!&quot; Vaclav replies. &quot;Plus she&#39;s been talking with Jackie tonight, and Jackie thinks you&#39;re going home 6 to 1.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m in, then,&quot; says Monty. He spits beside him. &quot;I ain&#39;t goin&#39; home this early.&quot;

//&quot;Jackie is a spoiled little girl, and her attitude is one I don&#39;t work with,&quot; Monty explains. &quot;So if she wants me out for not being a twenty-something model boy, then she&#39;s not worth my breath. And Tara may be nice, but she&#39;s picked her side. Too bad it&#39;s the side I don&#39;t like anymore.&quot;//

Buddy is sitting by the fire, not too happy with the idea of being surrounded by a different tribe&#39;s drama when Paula walks over to him and sits down.

&quot;Hi, Buddy,&quot; says Paula. &quot;Can we talk for a second?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s why you kidnapped me, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Buddy replies.

&quot;Well, yeah,&quot; says Paula. &quot;Vaclav and I are going to vote out Tara, and we think Monty is going to join us. We only need your vote to make it four.&quot;

&quot;Why do you want her out?&quot; Buddy asks.

&quot;It&#39;s more Vaclav wants her out than I do,&quot; Paula explains. &quot;He thinks she wants to turn him into a squirrel or something? I think there&#39;s something not all there with him. But Tara&#39;s not very strong, and I&#39;m concerned about if someone is going to call her bluff.&quot;

//&quot;I didn&#39;t expect it to pan out this way, but here we are,&quot; says Paula. &quot;Here I am, counting on someone from another tribe to swing the majority in my favour. Don&#39;t get me wrong, Tara&#39;s a nice girl, but I&#39;d rather lose her than Monty right now.&quot;//

After Paula had left, Jackie decides it&#39;s her turn to try and sway Buddy. &quot;I think you should vote out Monty, with us,&quot; she says.

Buddy raises an eyebrow. &quot;Is that so?&quot;

&quot;Yeah because, like, everyone else wants him out so you&#39;d look bad if you tried to save him,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;And it will determine if you and your tribe are, like, worth trusting.&quot;

&quot;Why should I care what you think about us?&quot; Buddy asks.

&quot;Look, forget it,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;Monty just sucks on a personal level, but he helps us around at camp so if you vote us off over Tara you&#39;re sort of weakening us. Isn&#39;t that what you guys want, anyways?&quot;

&quot;Oh, wow, that&#39;s tempting,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;I&#39;ll have to think it over.&quot;

&quot;You better pick correctly,&quot; Jackie replies. She turns to walk away but stops. &quot;Oh, and by correctly, I mean vote Monty.&quot;

//&quot;I don&#39;t get what kind of tribe would be so fractured on day three that they give me all the power,&quot; Buddy admits. &quot;It&#39;s difficult to wrap my head around. I can vote Tara out, and get rid of a wild card that benefits another tribe short term. But I can also vote out Monty, and that would just serve to make Jackie try and eat the tribe alive. It&#39;s a matter of who here can help me when a swap or merge hits.&quot;//

$v[**Tribal Council**]

The six members of the Quibas tribe, along with Buddy, walk into the tribal council building. This season, it looks like a small temple of sorts, with the insides plastered and renovated to look fresh. Ornate tapestries adorn the walls. The very back of the building has an open roof, to let out smoke from the fire burning by the back wall.

$v[&quot;You can all come forth and ignite your torch from the fire,&quot;] says Vincent. As they do so, he continues: $v[&quot;In this game, fire represents life. When your torch goes out, so do you. Take a seat.&quot;]

The seven contestants sit down in the stools that form a crescent shape in the middle of the room, facing the fire. Buddy sits in the very middle, holding the bottle given to him at the challenge.

$v[&quot;Paula, it felt like progress in that challenge for your tribe was very off and on. Has that influenced your decision at all?&quot;]

&quot;For the most part, not really,&quot; says Paula. &quot;I think for the most part people had already decided which way they were going to vote before the challenge even happened. Mostly it&#39;s just settled on who&#39;s the target for each side.&quot;

$v[&quot;Meaning the two who performed the weakest?&quot;]

&quot;That would make the most sense,&quot; Paula replies. &quot;That&#39;s not the case.&quot;

$v[&quot;Jackie, does this make sense to you?&quot;]

&quot;It makes perfect sense,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;The person leaving tonight has it coming.&quot;

&quot;Monty doesn&#39;t have anything coming,&quot; Vaclav interrupts. &quot;I don&#39;t get why you&#39;re so bent on getting rid of him, but he&#39;s not the worst one here, okay? He&#39;s a good guy!&quot;

&quot;Boring,&quot; says Jackie.

$v[&quot;Vaclav, are you saying you&#39;re voting based on who you think is &#39;worse&#39; than the others?&quot;]

Vaclav nods. &quot;My vote is for my own safety. And not just as in safety from elimination.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not actually in danger, though,&quot; says Khall. &quot;That would be a little too dark, even for this series.&quot;

$v[&quot;Monty,&quot;] Vincent asks, $v[&quot;is this conflict that Vaclav has with someone else on this tribe good for you?]

Monty shakes his head. &quot;No, because I know I don&#39;t deserve to go either way. It don&#39;t change a thing. Our plan is still the same.&quot;

$v[&quot;Paula, do you know what this plan is?&quot;]

&quot;Yes, I do,&quot; says Paula, &quot;but that&#39;s what we&#39;re here to prove, isn&#39;t it? Trial by fire.&quot;

&quot;Honestly, you aren&#39;t doing yourself any favours,&quot; Jackie replies. &quot;You&#39;ve been really wishy washy, how are we supposed to know if you&#39;re with us or against us if you don&#39;t admit to anything?&quot;

&quot;You expected me to commit to a final two alliance on day one,&quot; Paula snaps. &quot;You need to chill out.&quot;

&quot;Well, YOU need to tell me if you&#39;re with me or against me.&quot;

Paula smirks. &quot;I guess that means I&#39;m against you, then, Jackie. You want to play? Let&#39;s play.&quot;

$v[&quot;Tara, how do you see this as someone looking on the outside?&quot;]

&quot;This is affecting all of us,&quot; says Tara. &quot;It&#39;s not just about Monty and Jackie now, but now everything is starting to be coloured in this abrupt war between two sides. It&#39;s not fun. We have our own problems to deal with.&quot; She looks directly at Vaclav while saying this, making him freeze and tense up in his seat.

$v[&quot;Lastly, Buddy, as a member of the Chalpe tribe, how do you deal with something like this? Are you planning to settle the dispute, or ignore it?&quot;]

&quot;Well, since I have immunity, which I want to keep by the way,&quot; says Buddy, &quot;I&#39;m making this vote to benefit myself. Just as I would if this was on my own tribe.&quot;

$v[&quot;Okay then,&quot;] says Vincent. $v[&quot;It is time to vote. Vaclav, you are first.&quot;]

...

Monty reveals his vote to be for **Tara**. &quot;You have a winning spirit. But this is my alliance&#39;s plan, and they&#39;re the ones looking out for me.&quot;

Tara reveals her vote to be for **Monty**. &quot;Sorry that it has to end like this.&quot;

...

$votesarein





$v[&quot;Monty.&quot;]





$v[&quot;Monty. That is two votes Monty.&quot;]





$v[&quot;Tara.&quot;]





$v[&quot;Tara. We are tied, two votes each.&quot;]

Jackie glares at Paula, who winks and smiles in return.



$v[&quot;Tara. She takes the lead with three votes.&quot;]

Khall and Tara hold hands.



$v[&quot;Monty. Three votes Monty, three votes Tara, one vote left.&quot;]

The entire tribe looks over at Buddy, attempting to figure out how he voted.



$v[&quot;Final vote, and the first $boot is… Tara. You need to bring me your torch.&quot;]

&quot;Oh… I&#39;m sorry, guys, whatever I did,&quot; says Tara, sadly. She gets up, letting go of Khall.

&quot;I&#39;ll miss you,&quot; says Khall.

As Tara grabs her torch, she passes by Khall, and ruffles the top of his hood. &quot;Do well, okay?&quot; She places her torch in front of Vincent.

$v[&quot;Tara, the tribe has spoken.&quot;] He snuffs the gray rabbit&#39;s torch. $v[&quot;It&#39;s time for you to go.&quot;]

Tara silently exits the building with her belongings.

$v[&quot;And on a heavily divided tribe, it appears that a bystander took the fall tonight based on where their loyalties lied,&quot;] says Vincent. $v[&quot;Next time you may kidnap someone with a different agenda, so the game is by no means over for the minority voters. Keep that in mind as you head back to camp.&quot;]



//$q[&quot;I really didn&#39;t expect to be the one to get voted out here,&quot; Tara admits. &quot;I guess not everyone sees it coming, though. I shouldn&#39;t have been so passive, I think that&#39;s what got me. I hyped myself up but did nothing about it. But at least I made a friend before he left.&quot;]//

Vincent stops the Quibas tribe before they can get up and leave.

$v[&quot;One more thing. Buddy, I gave you that bottle at the challenge. I&#39;d like you to open it.&quot;]

Buddy nods, takes the cap off the bottle, and removes the note from inside.

&quot;After you have voted off a member of the Quibas tribe,&quot; he reads, &quot;it is time for you to walk down your own road. You will not return to the Quibas camp, and you must part ways with them at the Town Square.&quot;

$v[&quot;You can now head back to camp.&quot;]

&quot;Wow, that was a lot of walking,&quot; says Khall. &quot;It must have been like five minutes to get here, and then it&#39;s another fifteen to get back to camp.&quot;

&quot;Um, yeah,&quot; Paula replies. &quot;There&#39;s a lot of ground we need to cover. What were you expecting?&quot;

&quot;I thought we would be at our camp,&quot; Khall explains, &quot;then a brief few seconds of walking with our torches, and then it&#39;s a smooth transition to nighttime at tribal council.&quot;

&quot;Are you serious? That&#39;s just how they edit the scenes,&quot; says Buddy.

Jackie gives a disappointed look. &quot;Khall, you&#39;re an idiot.&quot;

Khall lowers his head in shame. &quot;Yeah, I know...&quot;

&quot;Well, that tribal was something I don&#39;t want to go through again any time soon,&quot; says Paula. &quot;Can we work together in challenges and not take what just happened personally?&quot;

Khall nods. &quot;I&#39;ll do it for Tara.&quot;

Paula looks expectantly at the other members of the tribe until they each agree as well.

//&quot;That was really nerve-wracking,&quot; explains Paula. &quot;Everything was going so fast, I didn&#39;t have the time to step back and think &#39;okay, am I doing the right thing?&#39; It&#39;s too early to call this a win, we need to see how the five of us can operate.&quot;//

Jackie looks over at Buddy. &quot;So why did YOU vote her out?&quot;

&quot;Why should you care?&quot; Buddy snaps. &quot;It&#39;s too late to do anything about it.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not too late to do anything about the mess you might have just caused,&quot; Jackie replies. &quot;The way I see things, we were all on the same page until around the time you showed up.&quot;

//&quot;The one person on this tribe that I actually trusted here is gone,&quot; says Jackie with a huff. &quot;And it&#39;s total BS the way it happened. If it wasn&#39;t for that stupid kidnapping twist I might have been able to actually vote out Monty. But you know, Buddy&#39;s not on this tribe, so I&#39;m going to needle him about it until I find out the truth.&quot;//

&quot;I didn&#39;t see it that way,&quot; Buddy replies. &quot;There were some people saying pretty much every name except for Paula and Khall. I just let you guys sort things out and then picked a side. It&#39;s that simple.&quot;

&quot;I gave you the perfect reason to not vote out Tara,&quot; says Jackie.

&quot;Perfect for you, maybe,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;Unfortunately, I don&#39;t really give a damn what you want. I voted her out, now you&#39;re going to have to live with it.&quot;

&quot;Fine,&quot; Jackie snaps. &quot;Well, if you&#39;re not going to be helpful, I&#39;m headed back to camp. OUR camp.&quot; She turns back towards the Quibas campsite, clenching her fists.

&quot;I&#39;m going with her, just in case she tries to, you know, vent,&quot; says Vaclav. He chases after Jackie.

Monty then turns to Khall. &quot;I know she was your friend, but V-Man didn&#39;t give us much of a choice. Don&#39;t take this too hard, okay?&quot;

&quot;Just don&#39;t vote me out next,&quot; Khall replies. &quot;Then we should be okay.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re probably the safest one on the tribe right now,&quot; says Paula. She puts a hand on Khall&#39;s shoulder. &quot;This wasn&#39;t an attack on you. You may have liked her, but Vaclav wasn&#39;t the only one worried about her. I got nervous. But keep it together, we want to keep you over Jackie.&quot;

//&quot;So far, everything I thought I would be here for just went out the window,&quot; says Khall. &quot;I thought I would be in the background, doing my own thing, but I just lost my best friend and now I&#39;m in the minority. I have some thinking to do about what my game plan is, and that&#39;s not my strong suit.&quot;//

Eventually, the town square clears out, and only Buddy and Paula remain.

&quot;Okay, I know Jackie can be kind of difficult,&quot; says Paula, &quot;but I think you went a little harsh on her.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Buddy replies. &quot;It&#39;s honestly none of her business how I play. If she thinks she was entitled to my vote because she supposedly had the better strategy, then she needs a wake-up call.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have to be the one to deliver it,&quot; says Paula. &quot;It pays to let other people do the talking, you know. I know we have to work together, but I might not be able to bail you out if you put yourself in a tricky situation.&quot;

&quot;It shouldn&#39;t have to come to that.&quot; Buddy puts his hands on his hips. &quot;I can handle myself fine, just like I hope that you can. The last thing we want is people getting suspicious of our relationship.&quot;

//&quot;Paula and I have been best friends since the fifth grade,&quot; Buddy admits. &quot;Getting casted on the same season was a total coincidence, but I&#39;m glad it happened because I know she has my back.&quot;//

Paula smiles. &quot;Thanks for coming through on the Tara vote, though.&quot;

&quot;Once you told me you were putting her name down,&quot; Buddy admits, &quot;there wasn&#39;t a doubt in my mind about what I needed to do.  You have a great opportunity here, now make good use of it.&quot;

Before either of them could wrap up the conversation, Rocky emerges from the path leading to the Ochora camp.

&quot;Um... what are you doing here?&quot; Rocky asks.

&quot;Wait, you don&#39;t know?&quot; Buddy replies. &quot;This is the Town Square, where all three tribes can meet. It&#39;s like a communal area, and it&#39;s on the way back from Tribal Council.&quot;

&quot;I did not know that was a thing.&quot; Rocky crosses his arms. &quot;All I know is that Min-Ji went down here yesterday and told us it was a dead end.&quot;

Paula raises an eyebrow. &quot;And she didn&#39;t even bring back the flint?&quot;

&quot;The what now?&quot;

//Rocky stares somewhere behind the camera with an icy glare. &quot;So I gave Saul a hard time for not being able to make fire without flint. Min-Ji tells me we don&#39;t have flint. Now I&#39;m finding out that not only is the flint right here for the taking, but Min-Ji left it here to make me look like a jerk. Well, you know what? I&#39;m not here to be toyed with, and I&#39;ll see to it that she learns why nobody messes with me.&quot;//

&quot;Well, I&#39;ll be back later,&quot; Rocky says bluntly. &quot;I have some smug, dishonest, backstabbing business to take care of.&quot; With that, he turns off and marches back to his camp, even angrier than Jackie was.

Buddy turns back to Paula. &quot;With any luck, the green tribe is going to start crumbling and we won&#39;t have to worry about saving each other.&quot;

$o[**Ochora Tribe**]

Candace is sitting by herself on the ground, in lotus position. She appears to be repeating some affirmations to herself.

&quot;I&#39;ve made up my mind,&quot; she says softly. &quot;Make a move... understand it&#39;s all in your head... it&#39;s your move...&quot;

//&quot;This is a trying time for me,&quot; Candace admits. &quot;I want to be in a new environment for a little while, maybe let it give me a new perspective. I&#39;ve also been continuing my meditation, to keep my mental abilities fine tuned.&quot;//

Candace continues to whisper to herself, not noticing Rocky tiptoeing from behind. &quot;Give up on trying to sell things that they aren&#39;t buying.&quot;

Rocky quickly taps her on the shoulder. Candace winces as if she had just stubbed her toe on the edge of the table, before turning around to face him.

&quot;Rocky,&quot; Candace says with a bit of bitterness, &quot;I was in the middle of something. This better be worth it.&quot;

&quot;It definitely is,&quot; Rocky replies. &quot;I found something BIG, and I need a witness before anything happens.&quot;

Candace gets up. &quot;This better not be a prank.&quot;

&quot;Why would I want to do that?&quot; Rocky asks innocently.

&quot;It just seems like something you&#39;d do,&quot; Candace responds.

&quot;How?! You&#39;ve only known me for four days!&quot; Rocky snaps.

//&quot;I&#39;m confused as to why I suddenly have a terrible reputation,&quot; Rocky admits. &quot;Somebody is trying to set me up. I have a feeling it&#39;s Min-Ji or Jarrett, and I wouldn&#39;t mind getting back at them &#39;cause they turned out to be bores.&quot;//

Min-Ji, meanwhile, had called a tribe meeting with Jarrett, Ashleia, and Saul.

&quot;So, I have just a quick question for you all,&quot; Min-Ji says. &quot;I think that we should be talking about who we end up voting out. Mainly because I&#39;m not sure if we can make it to the swap without losing.&quot;

Saul nods. &quot;I... do not sense that happening. Which is why I think it would be best for us if we vote out Rocky first.&quot;

&quot;Definitely,&quot; Jarrett replies. &quot;Rocky&#39;s a dick. We all know this. And he&#39;s really not that much stronger than Candace, so it&#39;s no question.&quot;

&quot;Inattentiveness is better to deal with than hostility,&quot; Min-Ji adds.

//&quot;I can&#39;t get a good read on Candace,&quot; Min-Ji says flatly. &quot;She&#39;s juggling maybe three different personalities. But the truth of the matter is, at least none of those personalities are toxic, so that&#39;s why she&#39;s safe for now.&quot;//

&quot;Should we talk to Candace about this?&quot; Saul asks. &quot;She might feel hurt if we left her out of the discussion.&quot;

Jarrett narrows his eyes. &quot;I don&#39;t see why that&#39;s important. We have four, that&#39;s all that matters. If she doesn&#39;t vote Rocky, she&#39;s next anyways.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve seen her with Rocky a lot recently,&quot; Min-Ji says. &quot;As far as we should be concerned, they&#39;re basically aligned. Once Rocky&#39;s out it might be a different story.&quot;

&quot;Someone has to keep him occupied so he does not have time to look for an idol,&quot; says Saul.

//&quot;I am pleased that we can come to a consensus,&quot; Saul says with a hint of anxiety. &quot;Although I can only help but to feel uncertain about how to deal with Candace. I do not agree with Jarrett&#39;s ideas of her in the slightest. She is no villain.&quot;//

After the meeting, Min-Ji and Saul stay together to discuss their plans.

&quot;I think the four of us are a solid group,&quot; Min-Ji tells him. &quot;We should be able to all make the swap, and if we can do that then we can rely on each other. As long as we can get rid of Rocky, we can&#39;t have them intimidated by having six Ochora hanging around.&quot;

&quot;Does this mean Candace would be the boot if we lose twice?&quot; Saul asks. &quot;I do not recommend we should be so quick to discard her.&quot;

&quot;Oh good, we&#39;re on the same page after all,&quot; says Min-Ji. She smiles. &quot;Yeah, I didn&#39;t intend on us four staying together. I think what we should do is get Candace on OUR side and vote out Ashleia. She&#39;s an extra vote for Jarrett, and if we save Candace she&#39;ll be more loyal to us than to him.&quot;

&quot;Okay,&quot; says Saul. &quot;You sound like you know what you are talking about. I urge you not to jump the gun, though. Rocky first, then Ashleia.&quot;

//&quot;Everyone has to go at some point,&quot; Min-Ji says with a smirk. &quot;The Rocky vote will lull the others into a false sense of security, and then we can force the others&#39; hands by voting out Ash. Then Jarrett and Candace will HAVE to side with us.&quot;//

Jarrett is holding his own meeting with Ashleia in the shelter.

&quot;Um, Jarrett?&quot; Ashleia asks. &quot;Are we, like, really going to vote out Candace if we lose twice?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not totally sure on that,&quot; Jarrett admits. &quot;To be perfectly honest, all three of them are expendable. It&#39;s just a matter of who we can hold on to for longer. Are Min-Ji and Saul worth voting Candace out over?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; says Ashleia.

&quot;We can figure it out,&quot; Jarrett continues, &quot;IF we get to that point. I&#39;d like it if we can just get rid of Rocky and have the five of us dominate the other tribes.&quot;

//&quot;I&#39;m really not comfortable with leaving this up to chance,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;Like, anyone would tell you that I don&#39;t go to Vegas to win. I mean, what if we lose twice, and then they vote me out because I&#39;m not very strong and they want a stronger group?&quot;//

&quot;Ugh, it would be so much better if the other tribes, like, could talk to us.&quot; Ashleia shakes her head. &quot;We don&#39;t want to, like, just trust that Candace won&#39;t flip. And maybe someone else will want to flip, so if we could just, like, make sure it&#39;s to us.&quot;

&quot;We can only think about what we can do on this tribe,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;Wishful thinking won&#39;t get us anywhere.&quot;

&quot;But are we doing the right thing?&quot; Ashleia asks.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about that,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;Let me do the talking, you worry about making sure the others aren&#39;t trying anything behind our backs.&quot;

//&quot;Ashleia, she&#39;s... trying real hard.&quot; Jarrett shrugs. &quot;Which is more than I can say for some people here. We hold the power here, so if the others can just continue to not see the bigger picture then making merge should be smooth sailing. And from there... we&#39;ll have to see what I can do at the swap.&quot;//

$q[**Chalpe**]

&quot;Look who found the flint!&quot;

The light pink tribe turns their heads to see Buddy triumphantly returning to the campsite. He is holding flint in one hand. &quot;It was on the way back from tribal council. I&#39;ll explain later, for now we need to get started on a fire.&quot;

&quot;Great news!&quot; Lisa cheers. &quot;We mustn&#39;t dilly-dally in making a place for the fire to go!&quot;

Jennifer picks up the machete and walks it over to Buddy. &quot;Think you can get a flame going?&quot;

&quot;Oh, definitely.&quot; Buddy takes the machete and waits for Lisa, Denine, and Rhett to bring over a few dried twigs and other kindling.

//&quot;Whoop dee doo, flint,&quot; says Louie. &quot;Not a big deal for me, since I have natural insulation. Maybe now at least they won&#39;t have the temptation to sleep on top of me.&quot; He rolls his eyes. &quot;Yes, they are still doing it.&quot;//

Buddy tries his hardest to get a fire started by striking the machete against the flint, harshly and deliberately. To his irritation, nothing was catching.

&quot;You&#39;re striking the flint, not chopping it up,&quot; says Denine.

&quot;I see sparks,&quot; Buddy replies, &quot;I got this.&quot;

A minute later, Denine speaks up again. &quot;You&#39;re still not making any progress.&quot;

Buddy annoyedly puts down the flint and machete, and stands up. &quot;Look, Denine, if you know so much about how to start a fire with a knife and flint, why don&#39;t you do it?&quot;

&quot;I will, just watch,&quot; says Denine. She takes the tools for herself and gets to work.

//&quot;Some things aren&#39;t cut and dry,&quot; Buddy explains, &quot;when nature has a thousand different variables to make your life more difficult. Denine apparently didn&#39;t realize that, and I can&#39;t stand having overly critical people like her breathing down my neck and putting even more pressure on me.&quot;//

Denine attempts to get a spark by going slowly and methodically, ensuring she gets the right angle every time. After a few minutes, Buddy gets annoyed.

&quot;Look, you&#39;re just doing the same thing I was,&quot; he says, &quot;only slower. You haven&#39;t even got any sparks to show for it either.&quot;

&quot;This takes time,&quot; Denine snaps.

&quot;What, are you waiting for a sign from the heavens?&quot; Buddy snaps back. &quot;We&#39;re moving BACKWARDS in terms of progress!&quot;

&quot;I know what I&#39;m doing! At least when I do get a spark, it will actually ignite!&quot;

Jennifer gets up and walks over to the fire pit. &quot;Alright, both of you, shut up. You&#39;re wasting energy arguing that you could use, oh I don&#39;t know, actually helping us.&quot;

&quot;Tell Buddy to get off my back,&quot; Denine tells her.

&quot;Me, getting off YOUR back? You dragged us into this!&quot; Buddy argues.

//&quot;The honeymoon was short, our tribe is falling apart,&quot; says Rhett with a sigh. &quot;Was this group hand picked to fail? I feel like anything could have set those two off, and it might not get better.&quot;//

Lisa pulls Louie aside to talk to him alone.

&quot;I am ashamed that some of our tribemates have fallen to this level of animosity,&quot; she says with a tinge of disappointment. &quot;I believe we should discuss if we should vote out one of the two squabblers.&quot;

&quot;I already wanted to vote out Buddy,&quot; says Louie. &quot;He&#39;s a glory-seeking little brat.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t appreciate your word choice,&quot; Lisa replies. &quot;We should not stoop to their level. Regardless, what are your considerations with regards to voting Denine?&quot;

Denine, who was standing nearby, calls out &quot;Don&#39;t even! Take that thought right out of your head.&quot;

&quot;Oh, Denine! I apologize profusely!&quot; says Lisa. &quot;It was merely a hypothetical! I have no qualms with voting Buddy.&quot;

//&quot;I quite nearly got myself in a predicament there,&quot; Lisa explains. &quot;Denine was quite tense, and I did not intend her to witness me suggesting she be eliminated. Fortunately for her, this is not with a tribal council incoming.&quot;//

Lisa leaves to discuss a similar prospect with Rhett and Jennifer, while Denine sits down with Louie.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind voting either out, actually,&quot; says Denine. &quot;Lisa... ugh there&#39;s just something about her. She&#39;s so cutesy it&#39;s irritating.&quot;

Louie nods. &quot;It&#39;s a sort of sugary innocence that I suppose is supposed to be endearing?&quot;

&quot;Endearing, more like punchable,&quot; Denine replies.

&quot;Is she really worse than Buddy?&quot; Louie asks.

Denine stops to think for a moment.

//&quot;I&#39;m beginning to wonder if we&#39;re spoiled for choice when it comes to who we should vote out,&quot; Denine admits, &quot;or I&#39;m just growing to dislike everyone, one person at a time. Either way I won&#39;t feel guilt when it comes time to start mowing people down.&quot;//

$q[**Quibas**]

&quot;Monty, you have a minute?&quot;

Monty turns his head to see Jackie walking up to him.

&quot;Sure, I guess,&quot; Monty replies.

&quot;I want to apologize for going against you,&quot; Jackie explains. &quot;I kind of went, like, haywire. We should maybe work together instead of fighting.&quot;

Monty takes a deep breath before responding. &quot;Why should I go with you?&quot;

&quot;Paula and Vaclav are both young and fit,&quot; Jackie explains. &quot;They&#39;re going to gravitate towards each other, and it only makes sense that if something goes south, they&#39;re going to try to cut you loose first. If you go with them, you&#39;re at the bottom. Side with me, and Khall is nothing to be worried about.&quot;

//&quot;Well, I guess it&#39;s a good thing that Jackie wants ta bury the hatchet,&quot; says Monty. &quot;She got some smarts to her after all. But I&#39;m not going to trust her completely.&quot;//

&quot;One down, two to go,&quot; Jackie says to Khall.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asks her purple-clad ally.

&quot;Seeing as that the two of us are together, and the other three only came together to get Tara out,&quot; Jackie explains, &quot;then it&#39;s worth trying to get them all to turn on each other. They can&#39;t trust each other, because if they do then they&#39;ll take it easy and we might lose again.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s something wrong with your logic,&quot; Khall replies, &quot;but I&#39;m not exactly sure what it is.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s because it&#39;s flawless,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;I&#39;ve thought about this, and it&#39;s what we have to do.&quot;

//&quot;Khall is a dimwit, but at least he&#39;s a useful one,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;With him, I have two votes for the price of one since I&#39;m the one making all the decisions.&quot;//

Paula crosses her arms while listening to Jackie tell her about the importance of having a truce.

&quot;Don&#39;t you remember how close we used to be?&quot; Jackie adds to her increasingly lengthy monologue. &quot;I thought we had something, and I want to know if we can get that magic back.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, sorry, I voted her out already,&quot; Paula replies bluntly.

&quot;No, I don&#39;t mean Tara!&quot; Jackie protests. &quot;I mean us being a duo. We could go back to the plan we had!&quot;

Paula hums while looking upwards. &quot;I... maybe. I&#39;ll have to think about it.&quot;

 &quot;This again? You know, I can just tell the boys that I&#39;m up to side with them after all,&quot; says Jackie.

//&quot;My mom once told me that some people think like sports cars, quick and flashy,&quot; Paula explains. &quot;Other people are like pickup trucks, steady and reliable. I&#39;m the pickup truck, finding the path that&#39;s right for me, while Jackie is the sports car that&#39;s out of control and about to be wrapped around a tree somewhere.&quot;//

Jackie concludes her efforts by talking to Vaclav, this time bringing Khall with her.

&quot;Paula and Monty have a strong bond, you know,&quot; Jackie explains. &quot;Paula&#39;s the one who jumped to Monty&#39;s defense before you did. Aren&#39;t you concerned that they might be, I don&#39;t know, using you?&quot;

&quot;Maybe a little,&quot; Vaclav admits. &quot;But why would you be better? You two are solid! I&#39;ll just be third to you guys!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re already third to them,&quot; Jackie counters. &quot;They just wanted to make sure that Monty didn&#39;t leave. And now he&#39;s still here and they can kidnap someone to give them the numbers, so they don&#39;t need you anymore.&quot;

&quot;Isn&#39;t that what you want to do as well?&quot; Vaclav crosses his arms and tries to look stern, but still comes across as jittery.

Khall turns his head to Jackie. &quot;Yeah, I thought that was your plan.&quot;

&quot;NO IT&#39;S NOT,&quot; Jackie says abruptly. She turns to Vaclav. &quot;Don&#39;t listen to him! You&#39;re overestimating how much they care about you. They just wanted an excuse to vote off Tara, and you gave them the perfect one. And now how do they know you won&#39;t go crazy on one of them? What makes you think they&#39;ll take that risk?&quot;

//&quot;Jackie makes some good points, as much as I don&#39;t want to believe it,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;How do I know that Monty and Paula aren&#39;t just going to use me and then toss me aside? But why wouldn&#39;t Jackie and Khall do the same thing? Paula might have helped me get Tara out before she could hurt me, but I know they don&#39;t believe how serious that was! Do they see me as a joke?&quot; He buries his face in his hands.//

$t[**Town Square**]

&quot;So this is it?&quot; Candace asks. &quot;Rocky, what&#39;s the point of it?&quot;

&quot;Remember yesterday, when Min-Ji went down this same path and said it was a dead end?&quot; Rocky replies.

Candace nods. &quot;Wait... that was a straight path, there weren&#39;t any branches she could have taken.&quot;

&quot;Then she clearly lied to us,&quot; says Rocky.

//&quot;I gotta make sure Candace has all the facts, the real ones, from ME, before she takes someone else&#39;s side,&quot; Rocky explains. &quot;They&#39;re scheming something good back there, and I&#39;m not going to sit pretty and let them walk over me. So as Candace as my witness, I will smash anyone who doubts me into the dirt.&quot;//

&quot;I guess you weren&#39;t making this up as some sort of distraction,&quot; Candace admits. &quot;This is called the Town Square?&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; says Rocky, &quot;but don&#39;t tell anyone else.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not really a square,&quot; says Candace. &quot;Not that I want it to be one. Squares are so... artificial, and they can scar the earth in their bluntness, you know?&quot;

&quot;I really don&#39;t,&quot; Rocky replies.

&quot;Hey, they have a little podium for each tribe, let&#39;s see what the green one says.&quot; Candace walks over to the Ochora podium, only to find her tribe&#39;s flint.

&quot;What the hell? Why is it all the way over here?&quot; she asks.

Rocky shrugs. &quot;It was here when I got there, and the other tribes said it was like that for them too.&quot;

Candace considers whether this might be a bluff, but ultimately decides she has no reason to think so. &quot;Then if Min-Ji was here like you said, why didn&#39;t she take it?&quot;

&quot;Because she didn&#39;t want us to be talking to other tribes,&quot; says Rocky. He crosses his arms and smirks. &quot;That way, she doesn&#39;t have to worry about anyone saying voting me out first isn&#39;t the best idea.&quot;

&quot;Your justification is dead wrong,&quot; says Candace. &quot;But I guess if she wants to be the leader, then she wants to make sure she can oversee everything?&quot;

&quot;Whatever it is,&quot; Rocky replies, &quot;she&#39;s sabotaging the tribe. Whether she intends to or not.&quot;

//&quot;I have noticed that Rocky has a sickly aura,&quot; says Candace. &quot;It is one that seeks only to destroy and inflict grief. He is no fool, though, and if ridding our tribe of him is not guaranteed, it helps to know that I&#39;m his confidant, the one who will not be in harm&#39;s way if this... darkness manifests.&quot;//

$c[**Ochora**]

Candace is by herself, sitting on a treestump, meditating again. This time she is interrupted by Min-Ji.

&quot;Hey, is everything alright with you?&quot; Min-Ji asks. &quot;It&#39;s been a while since we&#39;ve seen you not be with Rocky.&quot;

&quot;I guess I&#39;ve been stuck keeping an eye on him, so he doesn&#39;t cause any funny business,&quot; Candace explains. &quot;Just as pollution will poison the earth when released, so too will he poison this tribe&#39;s feng shui.&quot;

Min-Ji scratches her head, trying to figure out what Candace means. &quot;Well, I guess the more important question is what&#39;s Rocky up to?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t say I was his babysitter,&quot; Candace replies dryly.

//&quot;Okay, seriously?&quot; Candace crosses her arms. &quot;What is with this tribe and blocking every attempt I make to reconnect with Mother Gaia? I need some kind of release once in a while!&quot;//

&quot;But what if he finds an idol?&quot; Min-Ji asks.

&quot;If you&#39;re so worried about it, maybe you should pitch in and help me out,&quot; Candace snaps. &quot;That goes for all four of you, by the way.&quot;

&quot;We all have our roles here,&quot; says Min-Ji. &quot;Sorry that yours isn&#39;t the most glamorous, but it has to be done.&quot;

&quot;So, what&#39;s your role?&quot; comes a voice from behind them.

Min-Ji and Candace turn around and see Rocky, glaring directly at Min-Ji.

&quot;Hiding the flint from the whole tribe so we all STARVE?&quot; Rocky growls. &quot;What a role!  You&#39;re so helpful, Min-Ji!&quot;

&quot;This isn&#39;t about you, Rocky,&quot; Min-Ji snaps.

&quot;Okay, one, you&#39;re full of shit,&quot; Rocky nearly yells. &quot;Two, I&#39;m making it about you now. You think you can get away with just hiding the season&#39;s big twist from everyone?

&quot;I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about!&quot; says Min-Ji, her tone getting angrier as well. &quot;Candace, what the hell did you tell him!?&quot;

&quot;Excuse me, what do you mean what did I tell him?&quot; Candace yells. &quot;He&#39;s a major tool, sure, but I&#39;m not the one who fed him lies!&quot;

//&quot;This is why I needed a stable four and not three,&quot; says Min-Ji. &quot;You get stuff like this happening. I figured that maybe Candace wouldn&#39;t be dumb enough to completely fall into Rocky&#39;s hands, but heeeere we go! Might need to go after her and not Ashleia if she&#39;s going to stick with this nonsense!&quot;//

Jarrett, Saul, and Ashleia then arrive, having ran as fast as they could.

&quot;We heard yelling,&quot; says Saul. &quot;What is happening over here, should we be concerned?&quot;

Min-Ji starts to explain herself, but Rocky merely holds out the flint for them all to see.

&quot;What the... where did you get that?&quot; Jarrett asks, stunned. &quot;And why did you hide that from us?&quot;

&quot;Min-Ji was the one who hid this!&quot; Rocky explains. &quot;There&#39;s this big space down the path where she said was a dead end, and that&#39;s where I found a flint for each tribe! The other tribes at least weren&#39;t dumb enough to leave theirs behind!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re bluffing!&quot; Min-Ji snaps. &quot;This is some last-ditch effort to save yourself from the inevitable conclusion that you&#39;re out next because you&#39;re a douchecanoe!&quot;

The rest of the tribe (minus Candace) nods.

&quot;Well screw you guys!&quot; Rocky growls. &quot;Sorry that I&#39;m not going to bend over for you all! I&#39;m here to win, and ALL of you should know better than to not mess with me! Especially you, Min-Ji, how dare you tarnish my name to make yourself look good-&quot;

&quot;It was already tarnished,&quot; say Min-Ji and Jarrett at the same time.

&quot;Shut up!&quot; Rocky snaps. &quot;Min-Ji, you&#39;re the one who&#39;s been making us all starve for your own little strategy! You could have just gotten the flint from there but noooo!&quot;

Min-Ji turns to Candace. &quot;Why did you let this happen? What&#39;s this Town Square bull about?&quot;

Candace&#39;s eyes lit up. &quot;So you ARE full of it! How did you know what it was called?&quot;

&quot;I never called it by name!&quot; Rocky adds.

&quot;Hey, no fair! You could have said that no matter what!&quot; Min-Ji calls back.

&quot;All&#39;s fair in love and war, sweetheart,&quot; says Rocky.

//&quot;Here we see the sneaky Min-Ji backed into a corner,&quot; says Rocky, with a fake Australian accent. &quot;Crikey, there&#39;s no escape from the ferocious Rocky armed with the TRUTH! It should be obvious, but this will definitely be the first of many that I take down!&quot;//

&quot;If you want proof, why don&#39;t you just walk down the path that Min-Ji insisted was a dead end?&quot; says Candace.

&quot;You can&#39;t vote me out just because I might have gotten lost!&quot; Min-Ji snaps. &quot;Isn&#39;t it more likely that Rocky&#39;s just been hiding the flint the entire time?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s really not, but nice try, thanks for playing.&quot; Rocky smirks.

&quot;Rocky, we still have five votes to get rid of you,&quot; says Saul. &quot;Even if you kidnap your biggest fan, you will have to admit defeat.&quot;

&quot;Never!&quot;

//&quot;I had another vision,&quot; says Saul. &quot;I felt anguish and tension, and saw a house of cards collapsing. This might mean Ochora is going to collapse... but please let that be after we vote Rocky out. There&#39;s always a swap to look forward to, and if that is when it happens then I will be okay.&quot;//

A little later, Min-Ji, Saul, and Jarrett broke away from the argument after it devolved into Rocky replying to everything with &quot;No, you!&quot;

&quot;See, this is why I&#39;m glad the four of us are together,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;Rocky is nothing but trouble, and Candace is just enabling him now.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, let&#39;s just take them out,&quot; says Min-Ji. &quot;Do you think we should try to split the vote since Candace clearly hasn&#39;t actually been watching Rocky?&quot;

Jarrett shakes his head. &quot;That would be opening us up to the kidnapped person siding with them. We need to be solid. But should we really target Rocky, or try to flush an idol by voting Candace?&quot;

&quot;I do not believe he has an idol,&quot; says Saul.

&quot;Better safe than sorry.&quot;

//&quot;If Rocky is going to be this difficult for Min-Ji to deal with, then the enemy of my enemy is my friend,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;If we could get Candace out when we lose, then use Rocky to toss Min-Ji and Saul, that would be glorious.&quot;

&quot;We should ask Ashleia what she thinks, first,&quot; says Saul.

&quot;Wait, where is she?&quot; Jarrett asks. &quot;Wasn&#39;t she there when Rocky was having a tantrum?&quot;

&quot;I thought she was with you!&quot; Min-Ji&#39;s eyes widen.

//&quot;At least I&#39;m not the only one who just assumed she was there,&quot; Min-Ji says. &quot;It&#39;s not a good look, though. Although as long as she doesn&#39;t see it, she won&#39;t really put two and two together.&quot;//

$c[**Chalpe**]

Jennifer and Rhett are standing in a creek they found some distance away from camp, trying to catch fish by closing in on them and snatching them out of the water.

&quot;This doesn&#39;t seem to be working,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;We HAVE fishing gear, you know, there&#39;s no reason we should be getting our pants wet.&quot;

&quot;I tried to use the gear for five hours yesterday, and I didn&#39;t get a single bite,&quot; Rhett replies. &quot;Do you have any better ideas?&quot;

&quot;Maybe a little bit more patience?&quot; Jennifer suggests.

&quot;My stomach disagrees.&quot;

//&quot;Rhett is really down to earth in a way nobody else on this tribe is,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;All four of the others have good reasons to be voted off, I think. I can&#39;t say the same for Rhett, so whatever I decide on doing, I&#39;d like him to be in the know.&quot;//

After another unsuccessful grab, Rhett looks up to face Jennifer, but she begins to speak first.

&quot;Hey, Rhett, I&#39;m thinking I might volunteer to be the tribe leader,&quot; she explains.

&quot;What have you been doing for the past five days?&quot; Rhett jokes.

Jennifer chuckles. &quot;I guess you&#39;re right. But I want you to be my partner in crime, because I trust you to be sane and collected while everyone else continues to fight amongst each other.&quot;

Rhett nods. &quot;I don&#39;t see why not. Never hurts to have a stable partnership. I can trust you, can&#39;t I?&quot;

&quot;You can,&quot; says Jennifer.

//&quot;I have my doubts about this,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;Jennifer may be a good ally to have, but she&#39;s already come off fairly strong. I know Buddy has told me how she&#39;s already starting to annoy him. If Jennifer isn&#39;t getting respect as a tribe leader, should I really be advocating for her to lead?&quot;//

&quot;Well, who should we vote if we lose?&quot; Rhett asks. &quot;Surely you have some kind of plan.&quot;

&quot;I think it would have to be Louie,&quot; Jennifer explains. &quot;Sure, he&#39;s a strong swimmer, but on land he&#39;s pretty weak. The first challenge was water-based, future ones he might be slowing us down.&quot;

&quot;If you&#39;re talking about strength,&quot; Rhett replies, &quot;I think Lisa might be the better bet. She&#39;s admitted she isn&#39;t much of a swimmer, and she&#39;s not that much better than Louie otherwise.&quot;

Jennifer looks to the side. &quot;Yeah, I guess, but Lisa&#39;s done nothing to make us angry at her... like all three of the others have.&quot;

&quot;Speaking of which, is Buddy really as bad as Denine and Louie claim he is?&quot; Rhett asks. &quot;Sure, he&#39;s a downer, and he has a knack for looking down on people. The thing is, those two are starting to swing the same way.&quot;

&quot;As long as they&#39;re not in cahoots,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;But if we don&#39;t vote Louie, we can&#39;t really go after Denine either, since they&#39;re already a pair.&quot;

&quot;But if we vote Louie,&quot; says Rhett, &quot;then Denine will be furious and-&quot; He stops mid-sentence, and points at a fish swimming at around his ankles.

Both Rhett and Jennifer rush to reach down and try to grab it, only to bash their heads together.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I got it!&quot;

Rhett rubs his head and stands up, only to see the fish was caught not by Jennifer, but by Khall.

&quot;Wait, aren&#39;t you on Quibas?&quot; Rhett asks.

&quot;He is,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

Khall stays silent for a few seconds. &quot;Well... can I keep the fish?&quot;

$c[**Quibas**]

//&quot;Okay, so I don&#39;t know where Khall has been today,&quot; says Jackie, &quot;but truth be told does it look like I care? I have more important things to worry about – making the majority freak out with a fake immunity idol made by yours truly.&quot;//

&quot;Now that I have a shot of turning things around,&quot; Jackie mutters while putting the finishing touches on her fake idol, &quot;maybe I can lull someone into a false sense of security. And then, if they try to split the votes, then we just get the kidnapper to vote with us!&quot;

She smiles as she places her idol in the dirt. &quot;I can just see the pain on their faces when they try to play this...&quot; She then runs to hide behind a bush and see if someone will find it.

Sure enough, she notices Monty arriving back at camp with some firewood. Monty notices the fake idol, barely hidden at all, and picks it up.

//&quot;I know Jackie wanted me out last time,&quot; says Monty, &quot;so an idol might be just what I need to make sure she doesn&#39;t do it again.&quot; He spits on the ground. &quot;Real shame that all I found was a rock tied to a stick.&quot;//

Monty sees Jackie hiding in the bush and walks over to her. &quot;Hey, Jackie, I found an idol! You want it?&quot;

Jackie curses under her breath, before getting up. &quot;Monty, you touched it first, so it&#39;s yours, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;I think you need to trust us more,&quot; says Monty. &quot;Consider this a token of good will, since we&#39;re working together now, right?&quot;

As the two continue to offer each other the fake, Vaclav arrives and picks it up where Monty was sitting.

&quot;Is this the idol they&#39;re talking about?&quot; Vaclav wonders aloud. &quot;It doesn&#39;t totally look like one, but those two aren&#39;t stupid.&quot; His brow furrows. &quot;Is this a setup? Is there some twist attached to it that could hurt my game? What if Khall saw me pick this up!? Oh god. I can&#39;t use this. I need to deal with this. Fire. Into the fire!&quot;

Vaclav hurls the fake idol into the fire, to the horror of Jackie and Monty, who turn around in time to see it.

&quot;MY FAKE IDOL!&quot; Jackie and Monty both cry out at the same time.

Vaclav looks back over to his tribemates. &quot;Wait, are you two serious?&quot;

//&quot;I&#39;m just as lost as I was when I thought it could be a real idol,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;Did that make sense to anyone else?&quot;//

$t[**Town Square**]

Paula paces around in front of the torches. &quot;Where could he be? I thought we agreed on this time of day.&quot;

She stops to reflect on whether she worded things correctly when someone taps her shoulder. She turns around to be face to hood with Khall.

&quot;Heya, Paula!&quot; he says cheerfully. &quot;Looking for someone?&quot;

Paula shrugs. &quot;Wondering if they&#39;re going to show, as well.&quot;

&quot;So I guess it&#39;s someone on another tribe,&quot; says Khall. &quot;Oh, that blond boy on the pink tribe that voted with us!&quot;

&quot;Why would it be him?&quot; Paula asks, nervously fidgeting behind her back. &quot;We shouldn&#39;t be putting all our eggs in one basket.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not a very good liar,&quot; Khall says flatly.

&quot;I&#39;m not-&quot;

Khall extends a gloved finger to her lips. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I think I know.&quot; Paula&#39;s eyes go wide in horror.

&quot;Paula has a boooyfrieeeeend!&quot; teases Khall, waggling his eyebrows.

//&quot;I think my heart skipped a beat,&quot; says Paula, &quot;if not a whole measure. I thought I was done before I had even started. But luckily, Khall seems to be innocent and harmless. Unless he knows the truth and is willing to spill, right now I would rather keep him over Jackie.&quot;//

The two hear a sudden shout from the direction of their camp.

&quot;What was that!? Should we go check it out?&quot; Paula asks, her face slightly pale.

Khall shakes his head. &quot;I don&#39;t think we should. It&#39;s best that they work it out themselves, and if it was really important the whole tribe would be there.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think it works like that,&quot; says Paula.

&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; Khall replies. &quot;I forgot that sometimes one person is left out of the loop for comedic purposes.&quot;

&quot;No!&quot;

//&quot;I&#39;m trying to be friendly with Paula, since I think she&#39;s the thinker of her group,&quot; says Khall. &quot;So if we can&#39;t get someone to flip, then hopefully Paula can say that I&#39;m worth keeping over Jackie. I didn&#39;t want to think about turning on someone so soon, but desperate times call for desperate measures.&quot;//

&quot;What are you two so worked up about?&quot;

The pair turns to see someone approaching from a different camp.

&quot;Oh, hi,&quot; says Paula. &quot;I don&#39;t believe we&#39;ve met. What&#39;s your name?&quot;

&quot;My name&#39;s Ashleia Berns!&quot; Ashleia says cheerfully. &quot;I&#39;m on the Ochora tribe. It rhymes with Laura!&quot;

&quot;I know how to say your tribe&#39;s name,&quot; says Paula, raising an eyebrow.

&quot;Well, at the start I used to forget,&quot; Ashleia replies. &quot;That helped me remember.&quot;

&quot;Geez, don&#39;t be so insensitive, Paula.&quot; Khall pokes Paula in the arm.

Ashleia looks around. &quot;So... what is this place, anyways? I&#39;m not at your camp, right?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve never been to the Town Square before?&quot; Paula asks.

Ashleia stops to think for a moment. &quot;No, but, like, we thought someone on our tribe was lying about it. So, I snuck out to take a look for myself! And I guess it&#39;s real.&quot;

&quot;But you already got the flint,&quot; says Khall. &quot;You sure you thought it was made up?&quot;

&quot;Oh... OH! He&#39;s right about everything then!&quot; Ashleia claps politely for herself a couple times. &quot;Everything&#39;s coming together! I have to go tell Jarrett!&quot;

Immunity Challenge**

Vincent welcomes each tribe to the challenge beach, before showing them a replica of a //quipu//, or a recording device consisting of spun and knotted threads attached to a single string or wooden bar.
He describes the next challenge as dealing with the devices, but instead of using the quipu as a counting device, one person on each tribe will be using them as a key to a block puzzle.
Each tribe has a wall consisting of twenty blocks sticking out of it that can be pushed and pulled into it.
Each block needs to be pushed or pulled a certain amount to open up a space inside the wall that a ball can roll through.
The first tribe to roll a ball behind every block in a single run wins immunity and comfort in the form of blankets. The second tribe to do so only wins immunity, and the third tribe goes to tribal council.

Quipu Readers: $c[Rhett], $o[Ashleia], $q[Paula]
Puzzle Solvers:
$c[Buddy, Jennifer, Lisa, Louie]
$o[Candace, Jarrett, Min-Ji, Rocky]
$q[Jackie, Khall, Monty, Vaclav]
Sit-outs: $c[Denine], $o[Saul]

At the last second, the quipu readers are given a cruel twist - their quipu each have 24 strings, each of the puzzle solvers is given a number that matches the number of a string that should be ignored, and they cannot use words to tell the reader which strings are to be ignored.

Paula decides to go one block at a time, realizing there are about five relative positions for a knot on each string.
Rhett assigns five blocks to each puzzle solver
Ashleia first tries to get everyone to tell them what number they have through charades

The challenge proves to be slow, but Paula&#39;s one-at-a-time approach lets Quibas make progress faster
Rhett starts out with Louie and the first five blocks. When Louie finishes his section, Ashleia is still playing charades to find the dummy strings, and Paula is already at string 11

When Ashleia has determined all four numbers, she lays her quipu on the ground and hides the four dummy strings. She then copies Paula&#39;s strategy of going string by string.
As Rhett and Buddy finish the second section, Paula is at string 19 and Ashleia is already at string 5

Rhett and Jennifer get to work on the third section, but while they do that Ashleia reaches her tenth string and Paula finishes with the last string.
Paula gestures to Khall to try rolling the ball through, but Khall trips over the ball instead. Vaclav picks it up and trips over Khall.

Rhett and Ashleia reach their 15th string at the same time, while Jackie places the ball at its starting position and lets it go through.
The ball successfully rolls through the tunnel on the first go, meaning $q[Quibas wins immunity and blankets!]

Ashleia proves to be slightly faster at interpreting the quipu than Rhett, and finishes up while Rhett is on his 22nd string. She gets Min-Ji to try to roll the ball through...

...it bounces out the back end of the puzzle about halfway through. Ashleia races to the quipu to try and figure out which one she messed up.

Chalpe is delighted by the opportunity to steal the win, but discover that Rhett also made a mistake.

A few minutes of frantic double-checking later, and one tribe manages to correct their mistakes and roll their ball through first.

$c[Chalpe wins immunity!]
$o[Ochora loses, and will have to vote out someone at tribal council]

Ochora is instructed to pick someone from the Quibas tribe to join them, but before anyone can debate, Rocky picks Paula.
Paula tells her tribe &quot;I&#39;ll be fine, see you tonight.&quot; and heads off with Ochora.

$o[**Ochora**]

The green tribe and Paula gathered in the shelter.

&quot;Well, that could have gone better,&quot; says Jarrett.

&quot;I don&#39;t know how it was so hard for the rest of you,&quot; Paula chimes in.

&quot;We don&#39;t need to hear how much better you are than us,&quot; Min-Ji interrupts. &quot;Just let us resolve something. Where did your tribe get flint?&quot;

Paula briefly considers telling the truth, but decides against it. She shrugs. &quot;I didn&#39;t find it, I&#39;m not the one you should be asking.&quot;

&quot;You found it at the Town Square, right?&quot; Candace asks.

&quot;Candace, it&#39;s obvious you&#39;re trying to cover for Rocky,&quot; says Min-Ji. &quot;Even Paula doesn&#39;t know-&quot;

&quot;Screw you, Min-Ji!&quot; Candace snaps. &quot;Screw you! You&#39;re a crap liar, a crap leader, and you&#39;re a crap...&quot; She pauses. &quot;You&#39;re a bitch!&quot; With that, Candace stands up and storms off.

&quot;Boy, you sure settled that argument,&quot; says Rocky.

//&quot;I try to keep a cool head,&quot; Candace explains, &quot;but there&#39;s only so much hostility and dishonesty that I can take. And as obnoxious as Rocky is, I&#39;m getting scared of Min-Ji showing her true colours. One of them has to leave tonight.&quot;//

&quot;Rocky,&quot; Saul says gently, &quot;it is no longer about the missing flint. We are concerned about your attitude.&quot;

&quot;Pssh, my attitude&#39;s fine!&quot; Rocky protests. &quot;I just don&#39;t work with fakes and liars.&quot;

&quot;Everyone lies in Survivor, dumbass,&quot; says Jarrett.

&quot;This is exactly what we&#39;re talking about,&quot; says Min-Ji.

&quot;Because if we were talking about the flint still, you&#39;d have to admit you were wrong,&quot; Rocky snaps. &quot;I get it now.&quot;

Saul holds his head. &quot;Guys... I&#39;m getting something...&quot;

&quot;Yeah, a reality check,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;Min-Ji, I&#39;m putting your name down tonight. You have nobody to blame but yourself.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m shaking,&quot; says Min-Ji sarcastically, as Rocky gets up and leaves.

//&quot;I only have one shot to survive tonight,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;Tonight, that&#39;s exposing Min-Ji as someone who&#39;s been destroying us from the inside. If these morons are as gullible as they are with her, they&#39;re dumb enough to turn on her.&quot;//

&quot;Okay, I had envisioned two bales of hay,&quot; Saul explains to the remaining players. &quot;One of which was sliced through with a green knife, and the other had some sort of critter pulled out of it.&quot;

&quot;So basically, one scenario in which you split the vote and one in which you all gang up on Rocky,&quot; says Paula.

&quot;That is indeed what I interpret it as,&quot; says Saul. &quot;But then... there was a fire and one of the hay bales turned to ash.&quot;

&quot;Which one was it?&quot; Ashleia asks.

&quot;I... do not know,&quot; Saul admits. &quot;Rocky was yelling about his vote around that time so I lost focus.&quot;

&quot;Can you just try and focus, see if you can remember?&quot; asks Min-Ji.

&quot;Min-Ji, I am not a DVR,&quot; replies Saul.

//&quot;I would like to believe my vision justifies our plan to vote out Rocky,&quot; Saul explains. &quot;Although now I fear we will never know. Funnily enough, that is another reason to vote him out.&quot;//

&quot;Do you ever get sequels to your visions?&quot; Ashleia asks.

&quot;Hmm... yes. But they always occur when the incident in question has occurred, and I cannot intervene any longer.&quot;

&quot;Oh, so like when movie studios let terrible movies get sequels!&quot; Ashleia nods. &quot;I get it now.&quot;

&quot;...right.&quot; Saul gets up and dusts off his pants. &quot;I am continuing to vote Rocky out tonight, maybe without him I will have the peace to see a whole vision again.&quot; He walks off, and Min-Ji hurries to follow him.

Ashleia, Jarrett, and Paula are left in the shelter.

&quot;Jarrett, what should we do?&quot; Ashleia asks. &quot;Like, I think if we all vote together we get to decide.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine with whatever you guys want,&quot; says Paula. &quot;I&#39;d rather not be responsible, if you know what I mean.&quot;

Jarrett nods. &quot;I know what we should do.&quot;

//&quot;Tonight, I have two choices,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;First, I can side with Min-Ji and eliminate Rocky. That will keep those two happy, at least. But I could use Rocky and draw first blood with Min-Ji, eliminating a rival. The only problem is that Saul will be mad... If he&#39;s capable of anger... but at least then he and Min-Ji don&#39;t have time to think of backstabbing me first. It all comes down to whether Rocky is more useful than the Min-Ji and Saul duo.&quot;//

$v[**Tribal Council**]

The Ochora Tribe, with Paula, walks into the tribal council building. The Ochora members ignite their torches during Vincent&#39;s fire-is-life spiel, while Paula merely places hers behind the seats when she sits down. The members of Ochora then turn to join her.

$v[&quot;Jarrett, give me a rundown of what has happened at your tribe in the past six days.&quot;]

&quot;We got to camp, we didn&#39;t have a fire for a little while,&quot; says Jarrett, &quot;and then Rocky claims he found it and that Min-Ji knew about it but didn&#39;t bring it.&quot;

&quot;Since we got our torches from the Town Square,&quot; Rocky interjects, &quot;it&#39;s not a claim anymore. We know it&#39;s a fact.&quot;

Min-Ji rolls her eyes. &quot;Ooh no, I told one little fib to make sure you didn&#39;t get the idol. A real tragedy for the rest of us.&quot;

&quot;You owe us three days&#39; worth of cooked rice,&quot; Rocky mutters.

$v[&quot;Min-Ji, are you targeting Rocky over this?&quot;]

&quot;I&#39;m targeting Rocky because he&#39;s an obnoxious man-child,&quot; says Min-Ji. &quot;He&#39;s impossible to work with or talk to.&quot;

$v[&quot;Those are some big words, Rocky. How do you respond to that?&quot;]

&quot;By voting against her,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;She nearly sank the tribe, after all.&quot;

&quot;Okay, I didn&#39;t starve you guys!&quot; Min-Ji snaps. &quot;We had plenty of food.&quot;

&quot;However crunchy.&quot; Rocky rolls his eyes. &quot;You know, from being RAW and all.&quot;

$v[&quot;Ashleia, you had the key role in today&#39;s challenge that sent you guys here. Looking at this, do you think you might be in danger regardless?&quot;]

&quot;I, like, hope not,&quot; says Ashleia, twirling a few strands of hair with her finger. &quot;I think it&#39;s too early to be looking at how strong you are at everything.&quot;

&quot;Challenges are always a concern,&quot; says Paula. &quot;It&#39;s what stops you from coming back here.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I know that much,&quot; Ashleia replies. &quot;But, like, how many more keep-a-boo challenges will we have?&quot;

&quot;Ashleia, the word you want is //quipu,//&quot; says Saul.

&quot;That doesn&#39;t make any sense, though.&quot; Ashleia trails off, trying to figure out what word Saul said with a weird accent.

$v[&quot;Candace, should Ashleia be worried? How does the challenge affect tonight&#39;s decision?&quot;]

&quot;Not very much,&quot; Candace admits. &quot;Rocky and Min-Ji have been bickering and fighting for a little while now. We all kind of want to vote one of them out for some peace and quiet.&quot;

&quot;Trust me, if you vote him out the last thing you&#39;ll have is peace and quiet,&quot; says Min-Ji.

&quot;You can&#39;t silence the truth forever,&quot; Rocky snaps. 

&quot;Both of you, shut up before they call in security,&quot; says Jarrett, suddenly very stern.

$v[&quot;Well, okay then. And with that, time to vote. Paula, do you want to give up immunity?&quot;]

&quot;No way, not with this going on.&quot; Paula crosses her arms.

$v[&quot;Then it&#39;s time to vote. Saul, you&#39;re up first.&quot;]

...

Min-Ji reveals her vote to be for **Rocky**. &quot;I&#39;d hate to be there if your delusions come crashing down.&quot;

Rocky reveals his vote to be for **Min-Ji**. &quot;You&#39;re shady, AND you&#39;re a killjoy! That&#39;s what I call a two-for-one.&quot;

...

$votesarein





$v[&quot;Rocky.&quot;]





$v[&quot;Min-Ji. That is one vote for Min-Ji and one vote for Rocky.&quot;]





$v[&quot;Next vote... Min-Ji.&quot;]

&quot;Thanks, Candace.&quot; Min-Ji glares at her. &quot;You know this just means you&#39;re next.&quot;

&quot;Bring it,&quot; says Candace.

$v[&quot;Rocky. We are tied again with two votes each.&quot;]

&quot;The moment of truth is upon us,&quot; Saul mumbles.



$v[&quot;Min-Ji. She leads with three.&quot;]

Rocky smirks.



$v[&quot;Second $boot is... Min-Ji. You need to bring me your torch.&quot;]

Min-Ji turns around quickly to face Jarrett. &quot;What the hell was that!?&quot;

&quot;What does it look like?&quot; Jarrett smirks. &quot;Pre-emptive strike.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s pre-emptive strikes,&quot; says Min-Ji, getting up, &quot;and there&#39;s being a moron.&quot; She takes her torch and walks it to in front of Vincent.

$v[&quot;Min-Ji, the tribe has spoken.&quot;] Vincent extinguishes the young Korean woman&#39;s torch. $v[&quot;Time for you to go.&quot;]

&quot;I look forward to seeing you join me,&quot; says Min-Ji.

&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; says Rocky.

$v[&quot;Tonight, it appears you chose the enemy you knew over the enemy you did not,&quot;] says Vincent. $v[&quot;Was Min-Ji right about this being premature, or will this prove to be the right move after all? You can head back to camp.&quot;]



$o[//&quot;What is that tribe smoking? Why on Earth would they keep Rocky over me? Why him over ANYONE?&quot; Min-Ji groans. &quot;I can&#39;t believe they&#39;re keeping him as a meat shield. Well guess what, you&#39;re going to need it when you lose again! What a bunch of snakes.&quot;//

Voting Results:
**Min-Ji - Ashleia, Candace, Jarrett, $q[Paula], Rocky**
Rocky – Min-Ji, Saul

&lt;span class=&#39;episode&#39;&gt;[[Introduction&lt;-Back to Title Page]]&lt;/span&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Cast Release" tags="" position="253,161" size="100,100">(set: $crazy to (colour: #33ff33))
A young, blond-haired man wearing a buttoned blue jacket shuffled through some papers. He was sitting behind a desk with two empty chairs across from him. A folder in front of him had the label &quot;Profiles - 3&quot;.

$v[&quot;I think I have everything ready,&quot;] he said. He looked up to address the camera. $v[&quot;Viewers, I believe the third season is upon us. So, to help me show you all what you&#39;re in for, I&#39;ve brought in a special guest.&quot;] He looked behind the camera. $v[&quot;Come in!&quot;]

The camera swivelled so that the man was sitting on the left side of the screen. A TV screen was mounted to the wall now facing the camera. Another figure entered the view of the camera, this one with a humanoid body structure but otherwise resembling a gray cat. She was wearing a white and green baseball cap, a plain red t-shirt, and blue shorts. The tip of her tail dragged on the carpeted floor behind her as she walked casually to one of the empty chairs - now on the right side - and sat down.

&quot;Pleasure to be here again, Vincent,&quot; she said cheerfully.

$v[&quot;Pleasure to have you back,&quot;] Vincent replied. $v[&quot;In case you didn&#39;t know, I am Vincent Boucher, the host and associate producer of Survivor: Mint Version. Here with me today is Tipper Masterson, the sole survivor of our first season. She&#39;s here to help me comment on the cast for our third season.&quot;]

Tipper nodded. &quot;Inca Legacy, right?&quot;

$v[&quot;It is,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;Eighteen castaways in the highlands of eastern Peru. Not only are they fighting to survive in the wilderness, but they will be getting the tiniest glimpse of how some civilizations prospered in the exact same conditions.&quot;]

&quot;Wait a minute, will they be doing challenges or anything like that in actual native ruins?&quot; Tipper asked.

$v[&quot;We have a dynamic cast in store for you all,&quot;] Vincent said, ignoring Tipper, $v[&quot;and we&#39;ve prepared just enough surprises to keep both the players and the audience on their toes. Let&#39;s not waste any more time.&quot;]

&quot;You nailed that introduction,&quot; said Tipper. &quot;You didn&#39;t stumble over your words or miss something even once.&quot;

Vincent crumpled a piece of paper and tossed it at Tipper. It bounced off her nose and fell into her lap.

&quot;Hey, rude.&quot;

$v[&quot;You sure are.&quot;] Vincent smirked, and shook his head.

Quite suddenly the pair noticed a strange shade of green emanating from the wall. A loud bang was heard, and on the wall appeared a circular green wormhole.

Vincent looked nonchalantly at the wormhole. $v[&quot;You’ve got to be kidding me,&quot;] he sighed. $v[&quot;I thought I told him none of that wormholey sci-fi sh-&quot;]

Two figures exploded out of the wormhole, one wearing a purple buttoned up shirt with a matching cap and blue jean shorts. He lost his hat upon entering revealing a smooth head of no hair. His eyes darted back and forth, looking anxious after the experience.

The second figure appeared halfway out of the wormhole, grinning like a slasher villain and adorned with goggles over his eyes and blazing green hair.

$crazy[&quot;Hot diggity!&quot;] said the green clad lad. $crazy[&quot;That’s how you travel!&quot;]

The young bald man looked more annoyed than grateful as he brushed his hat. &quot;You know, I really think you need to stop assuming people enjoy traveling like that!&quot;

$crazy[&quot;Ahhh, c’mon!&quot;] said the green haired man. $crazy[&quot;You were running late. This was the only way to get you here on time!&quot;]

$v[&quot;He’s //my// guest, cRaZy,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;He has the address, there’s nothing wrong with him getting here on his own two feet.&quot;] He looked down at his desk. $v[&quot;And now my files are blown all across the room.&quot;]

The green man just shrugged his shoulders and shook his head. $crazy[&quot;Yeah, yeah, whatever.&quot;] He then turned and looked back up. $crazy[&quot;Say, I was gonna go get a slurpee! Does anyone want one?&quot;]

&quot;We’re GOOD, thanks.&quot; The purple kid groaned. &quot;I’ll call you when this is over!&quot;

$crazy[&quot;Suit yourself, buddy.&quot;] cRaZy bowed over-dramatically, then turned around and dove deeper into the vortex. The wormhole closed with a pants zipper sound.

&quot;Man, that guy is so strange...&quot; sighed the young man.

$v[&quot;Well, you’re here, Oliver, and that’s the important part.&quot;] Vincent gestured to the empty seat next to Tipper, before turning to the camera. $v[&quot;We also have Oliver Oreals here with us. He was the runner-up of last season, Survivor: Shuffle Island. Now, let&#39;s start off with the first castaway.&quot;]
The TV turned on, first displaying the season logo before switching to a picture of an attractive young woman with long blonde hair, vibrant green eyes, and a glowing smile. She was wearing a diamond necklace, and she appeared to be wearing a light pink top. (The photo did not show below her chest, which would reveal it to be a short dress.)

&#39;&#39;Ashleia Berns
$o[thebigJET]&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Ashleia is a model who has a strategy of being adaptable and independent,&quot;] said Vincent, $v[&quot;but she&#39;ll most likely have some trouble fitting in. See, she&#39;s a very wealthy person, and has been her whole life. She knows what to expect coming onto the show, but she&#39;s totally out of touch when it comes to what her tribemates see as necessities and luxuries. Ashleia will need to rely on her caring personality, and possibly her good looks, if she wants to be taken seriously.&quot;]

&quot;Hmm, I want to think she has a chance if she can remain on the positive side of things, but if she starts prattling on about needless things, I can see where that can get really old, really quick.&quot; Oliver said, stroking his chin.

&quot;I have a feeling she&#39;s going to come down with a bad case of foot-in-mouth disease,&quot; said Tipper. &quot;If she&#39;s as naive as she looks, she will undoubtedly rub at least someone the wrong way, and I won&#39;t be surprised if the &#39;she doesn&#39;t need the money&#39; card comes into play.&quot;

Vincent picked up a clicker on the desk and pushed the button. A picture of the next castaway appeared. He was a college-aged male with a round face, dark blond hair, and blue eyes. He was wearing a gray t-shirt bearing the name of his university in blue and white. He looked very serious.

&#39;&#39;Buddy McLeod
$c[minty2mayhem]&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Buddy has two sides to him. On the outside is a grumpy, cold, and defensive guy who only looks out for himself.&quot;] Vincent sighed. $v[&quot;But on the inside, Buddy is very sensitive and hates seeing others inflict pain. He&#39;s an idealist, and he vows that this season won&#39;t be as dark as the one you were on.&quot;] He looked at Tipper when he said this.

&quot;Those don&#39;t exactly sound like compatible personalities,&quot; said Tipper. &quot;At least he doesn&#39;t sound like a self-righteous and hypocritical hero. Those are not fun to watch get their way.&quot;

$v[&quot;Who says that his strategy is foolproof?&quot;] Vincent replied. $v[&quot;I can confidently say that this season is going to put Buddy&#39;s confidence to the test.&quot;]

&quot;I have been in a lot of pressure situations from ORGs and Survivor seasons myself,&quot; said Oliver. &quot;In one of my philosophy classes I remember hearing a quote that went like this: &#39;If thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee.&#39; Let&#39;s just hope he doesn&#39;t let his ideals lead him astray.&quot;

&quot;I have no idea what the relevance of that is, but okay,&quot; said Tipper.

Vincent hit the clicker button again. The next castaway was another college-aged person, this one a woman with tan skin and brown eyes, but bright blonde hair. She was wearing a long-sleeved, sky blue shirt. Her wavy, shoulder-length hair was brushed over her hairline in one direction, rather than parting in the middle.

&#39;&#39;Candace Breyer
$o[minty2mayhem]&#39;&#39;

&quot;Aww, she looks cute.&quot; Oliver smiled. &quot;I like her.&quot;

$v[&quot;Candace is something of a philosopher herself. She is very relaxed and approachable, and believes that to succeed in the game, she can&#39;t let anything get under her skin,&quot;] Vincent explained.

&quot;Oh, wow, I&#39;m yawning already,&quot; said Tipper.

$v[&quot;Save it,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;Her biggest struggle so far is that she&#39;s a recovering drug addict, and she feels that a change of lifestyle will be able to give her a new perspective on living a clean life.&quot;]

&quot;Leading a new lifestyle choice is one thing, going cold turkey into a reality show might have a whole load of repercussions that I really don&#39;t want to think about.&quot; Oliver gulped. &quot;If she can manage to somehow not let her past haunt her she might have a really incredible growth story... I&#39;ll root for her and hope for the best.&quot;

Vincent hit the clicker button, and when he saw the next person he nearly sighed. The next castaway was another young woman with long brown hair, a slim physique and light brown eyes. She had a short pink tee, and a beaming smile.

&#39;&#39;Denine Magro
$c[minty2mayhem]&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Ah, Denine, she has so much enthusiasm I don&#39;t know where to start for her,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;She seems really into being on the show and pulling off moves and having a good time... there&#39;s nobody that I can say is readier for the show than she is.&quot;]

&quot;Hopefully she does more than just spout trivia the whole time,&quot; said Tipper, picking up a paperclip, &quot;or this is going straight into my eyeball.&quot;

&quot;Hmm...&quot; Oliver said, leaning into the image to inspect it carefully. &quot;I don&#39;t know about her. Being a fan of a show is one thing, being OUT THERE is a whole other kettle of fish entirely. I will say she probably won&#39;t last very long.&quot;

$v[&quot;The two of you are both only really seeing one side of her fan status,&quot;] Vincent replied. $v[&quot;There&#39;s more to her than that, but I would like to leave that as a surprise for now.&quot;]

&quot;Well I hope she proves me wrong then, because right now I have doubts.&quot; Oliver shrugged.

Vincent smiled, and clicked his clicker. The next castaway was yet another young woman, this one with long, bright blonde hair and green eyes. She was wearing a red and black plaid jacket, and she looked smug.

&#39;&#39;Jackie Potato
$q[meme12rose]&#39;&#39;

&quot;She looks familiar,&quot; said Tipper.

$v[&quot;I was wondering if you would notice,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;This is Jackie, the twin sister of Emily from your season. Like her sister, she is stubborn and cliquey, but that is about where the similarities end.&quot;]

&quot;Oh wow, a sibling on a new season?&quot; said Oliver, intrigued. &quot;I always like to compare and contrast relatives when they play on separate seasons.&quot;

$v[&quot;Putting them on the same season would be too cliché if you ask me,&quot;] Vincent replied. $v[&quot;Jackie prides herself on her strategic ability and is willing to do anything to get to the end. She&#39;s totally willing to be labeled the villain if it means she&#39;s playing the game right. I even remember her saying &#39;my game is going to be Inca Legacy, not Emily&#39;s Legacy.&#39;&quot;]

&quot;Hmmm...&quot; Oliver said after hearing that statement. &quot;I mean confidence can take people only SO FAR. I would hope she isn&#39;t all bark, but with a statement like that now I am starting to get early boot vibes from her.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m about confident she&#39;s going to shoot herself in the foot somewhere along the line. There&#39;s no way that she doesn&#39;t have at least something in common with Emily,&quot; said Tipper.

&quot;I agree.&quot; Oliver nodded.

Vincent chuckled, and pressed the button on his clicker. The next castaway was a fairly young man with dark skin and short black hair. He was wearing a red and white sports jersey, and he looked slightly surprised.

&#39;&#39;Jarrett Wayne
$o[minty2mayhem]&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Jarrett is a very blunt man, and he&#39;s not afraid to speak for his allies,&quot;] Vincent explained. $v[&quot;He doesn&#39;t like to bend to other people&#39;s wills, and he is determined to be an influential person himself.&quot;]

&quot;So, will he be trying to step up and lead, or does he just not want to be told what to do?&quot; Tipper asked. &quot;Depending on what his tribe pans out to be, one of those strategies will work out for him and the other one spells early boot.&quot;

&quot;I do see potential in him becoming a force of nature on his team,&quot; said Oliver, &quot;the question is will he be one of good or bad. I will say he&#39;s probably going to lean more on the antagonistic than the heroic.&quot;

Vincent shrugged and pressed the button on his clicker. The next castaway was a college-aged woman with medium-length brown hair and dark brown eyes. Her hair was mostly brushed over to her left side. She was wearing a denim jacket over a white undershirt, and she was smirking in her picture.

&#39;&#39;Jennifer Prince
$c[minty2mayhem]&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Jennifer doesn&#39;t take crap from anyone,&quot;] Vincent explained. $v[&quot;She&#39;s a wannabe leader who doesn&#39;t like conflict, but she&#39;s aware of her team dynamics. She will act for the good of her tribe, but she doesn&#39;t always see how strong she comes across.&quot;]

&quot;If I had any advice for her, it&#39;d be to pull back on the reins a little bit,&quot; Oliver pointed out. &quot;No one likes to be babysat, even if said watcher had good intentions. I think she might accidentally cause the powder keg to blow if she doesn&#39;t pick her battles correctly.&quot;

&quot;Who&#39;s to say her intentions are any good?&quot; Tipper replied. &quot;The good of the tribe isn&#39;t always the best way to go. You shouldn&#39;t be afraid to take a stand against the authority if said authority is a pile of garbage.&quot;

$v[&quot;Still bitter, are we?&quot;] Vincent asked, smirking a little.

Oliver just shuddered.

Vincent pressed the button on his clicker. The next castaway was wearing an indigo hood, and something with a brown strap. The whites of his black eyes were visible, but not even the profile of his face could be distinguished from the shadow underneath his hood.

&#39;&#39;Khall
$q[SSBFreak]&#39;&#39;

&quot;That might be the goofiest ninja I have ever seen.&quot; Oliver snickered at the big eyed hooded figure.

$v[&quot;How did you know he was- nevermind.&quot;] Vincent shook his head. $v[&quot;This is Khall... he&#39;s a bit of a goofball. He&#39;s very physically adept, but most of the time he just fails to get that across, so he looks more like a liability than an asset. He&#39;s not the sharpest tool in the shed, and he has an affinity for standing on inappropriately located flora and babbling about story conventions.&quot;]

&quot;I can&#39;t think of anything to say here, but...&quot; Tipper held her head in utter confusion.

&quot;As much fun as his personality might be, I am going to assume his unpredictable nature might just rub too many people the wrong way. As fun as it would be to see him bouncing around the place I don&#39;t see him lasting very long unfortunately.&quot; Oliver sighed.

Vincent clicked his clicker, revealing the next castaway: a young woman with platinum blonde hair, bright blue eyes, and a sweet smile. She was wearing a light blue top with spaghetti straps.

&#39;&#39;Lisa Peters
$c[minty2mayhem]&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Lisa is a very kind and respectful person, and she wants to prove that it&#39;s possible to win without making enemies,&quot;] Vincent explained. $v[&quot;She may appear to be a naive and innocent angel, but she is not afraid to take matters into her own hands and tell people what she wants them to do.&quot;]

&quot;I like her too,&quot; said Oliver. &quot;I find her spunky and she probably has the potential to be a real heroine of the season. I hope she can last long enough to see it through.&quot;

&quot;At least she&#39;s not expecting to get by on being pretty and non-threatening,&quot; said Tipper. &quot;If you&#39;re going to get on the show, at least try and play.&quot;

Vincent nodded. $v[&quot;Exactly.&quot;] He pressed his clicker and the next castaway appeared. This one was the first nonhuman of the cast, a pudgy anthropomorphic otter. He had dark brown eyes, a black and white visor, and an open blue jacket. His expression was a neutral one, as if he was getting a driver&#39;s license.

&#39;&#39;Louie Leingartner
$c[minty2mayhem]&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Louie may be a chubby surfing otter, three traits that correspond to cheerfulness, but Louie is not that,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;He&#39;s a very determined and stoic guy who finds himself most comfortable in a competitive environment. Arguably, his physical ability will be what determines whether he will go down swinging or make a real impact on the game.&quot;]

&quot;It&#39;s strange... I mean I can tell this guy has a story to tell, but I bet it will be something unexpected.&quot; Oliver rubbed his chin in thought. &quot;I can see him be a breakout hero or villain this season, and in both camps I can see him playing either role really well. He&#39;s my dark horse pick for the win regardless of any alignment he fills out.&quot;

Tipper scratched the back of her head. &quot;He looks like the kind of guy who will fulfill the carefree stereotype to your face, and then backstab you for the most minor infraction. I hope for his sake that nobody pushes him to that point.&quot;

&quot;Bad experience with otters too?&quot; asked Oliver with a hint of sarcasm.

&quot;Wait until a panther comes up, then we&#39;ll talk,&quot; Tipper snapped.

&quot;....&quot; Oliver went deadpan and glared at the screen with his arms crossed. &quot;NEXT PLEASE!&quot;

Vincent rolled his eyes and pressed the clicker button. The next castaway was a young woman of Korean descent. She had brown eyes with glasses, black shoulder-length hair, and a green clip in her hair. She was wearing a dark yellow shirt, and she was smiling slightly.

&#39;&#39;Min-Ji Han
$o[minty2mayhem]&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Min-Ji claims that she&#39;s a natural born leader, and she wants to keep her tribe focused and organized,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;Unlike many so-called leaders, she knows her tribe won&#39;t necessarily be a functioning unit, and she&#39;s willing to jump into the fold of tribe politics to make moves that interest only her, and then make sure what&#39;s left can bounce back.&quot;]

&quot;She&#39;s a realist.&quot; Oliver pointed out. &quot;Having the foresight of knowing when to fight and who to fight alongside can be a crucial advantage for some players. I bet she&#39;ll have a solid couple of rounds, but if people start to catch on she&#39;ll be in for some rough waters ahead. I&#39;ll root for her though because it&#39;s nice to see someone who is going to stick to their guns as opposed to folding to another&#39;s demands.&quot;

&quot;I figure she might be able to go the distance if she distinguishes team leader Min-Ji from game player Min-Ji,&quot; said Tipper. &quot;Might be more difficult than I make it sound.&quot;

Vincent nodded and pressed the clicker button. The next castaway was certainly the oldest so far - a man who looked to be in his early fifties or so, with short, graying hair and blue eyes. He had an overweight build and a dull green buttoned jacket.

&#39;&#39;Monty
$q[CKD]&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Monty is probably one of my favourites in the cast,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;He&#39;s a good-natured Southern construction worker who wants to try something different and learn about himself. He&#39;s not going to worry himself much with strategy, he&#39;s just out here to make some good relationships and have some good stories to tell his pals back home.&quot;]

&quot;I don&#39;t see him going far enough in running challenges, let alone in the competition,&quot; said Tipper. &quot;I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll have a great week or two in Peru, though.&quot;

&quot;Contrary to my associate, I have high hopes for Monty.&quot; Oliver grinned. &quot;An older guy with a easy going nature might just be what his tribe needs to stay sane. I mean, will it get him a win? I can believe he has the skills and personality to make a very solid end game resume among his peers. I think he&#39;s also in my top four to win.&quot;

&quot;I think his fellow competitors will be more like his kids&#39; peers than his own,&quot; said Tipper.

&quot;How did you win your season again?&quot; Oliver rubbed his temples.

Vincent sighed and pressed the button on his clicker. The next contestant was a college-aged woman with wavy black hair and brown eyes. She had a tan skin colour that suggested she was of Hispanic descent. She was wearing a green t-shirt, and she had a calm smile.

&#39;&#39;Paula Cortes
$q[minty2mayhem]&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Paula has a good head on her shoulders, but other than that I don&#39;t even think she knows what she&#39;s going to do,&quot;] said Vincent, stifling a laugh. $v[&quot;She says that she&#39;s going to assess everyone and try to play an intelligent game, but she has trouble under pressure. She could do well if she isn&#39;t caught off guard, I think.&quot;]

&quot;I&#39;m cool with that, as long as it doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s going to dominate this season and play everyone like a fiddle,&quot; said Tipper. &quot;For our sake, I hope she runs into something unexpected that throws her off and shakes up her game.&quot;

&quot;I mean she seems to have an idea how to play the game, but if her anxiety is really that big of a deal then her biggest obstacle will probably be herself,&quot; Oliver pointed out. &quot;If any conflict should arise from this season, most likely she&#39;ll be the one who inadvertently starts it.&quot;

Vincent nodded and clicked his clicker. The next castaway was a light-skinned young man with blond hair slicked back, and green eyes. He was wearing a blue and purple plaid shirt that looked a bit too wide for him. He looked contemplative.

&#39;&#39;Rhett Mason
$c[DoctorRoy]&#39;&#39;

&quot;I can appreciate a man in purple.&quot; Oliver smirked.

$v[&quot;Rhett is a cool, collected young man who thrives in social situations,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;He&#39;s a fan of debate, and he thinks that deep discussions are the best way to get to know a person&#39;s true character. If he can&#39;t do that, then he has trouble trusting them.&quot;]

&quot;I think he has potential to be a schemer of the season.&quot; Oliver said. &quot;I also get the impression that if he were to get a vote thrown at him, he might go on a witch hunt. I just hope he&#39;s not unbearable out there if he really focuses on debating about morality and trust all the time.&quot;

&quot;He looks like a wannabe used car salesman,&quot; said Tipper. &quot;You start out talking about where to build the shelter, and before you know it you&#39;re in a final two alliance and you&#39;re $50,000 in debt.&quot;

$v[&quot;There&#39;s a story there,&quot;] said Vincent. He pressed the button on his clicker. The next contestant was an anthro skunk wearing sunglasses and a black leather jacket over a red shirt. He appeared to be really annoyed about something.

&#39;&#39;Rocky
$o[Tinyhammer]&#39;&#39;

&quot;Say, Oliver, you&#39;re not going to be bitter about skunks too, are you?&quot; Tipper asked, half curious and half waiting for a reaction.

&quot;Only if they tie me to a pole and beat me.&quot; Oliver said not even looking at Tipper.

$v[&quot;We are NOT talking about that,&quot;] Vincent snapped. $v[&quot;Despite being about the same age as most of his competitors, Rocky here is very entitled and immature guy. His hobbies include partying, rock music, and booze. He picks fights with pretty much anyone, and he doesn&#39;t care what people think of him as long as he gets what he wants.&quot;]

&quot;Oh, he sounds like a saint.&quot; Oliver shook his head. &quot;The sooner his torch is snuffed the better.&quot;

&quot;I think I&#39;m in love,&quot; sighed Tipper. &quot;If there&#39;s a brain under there, I&#39;ll hope that he goes far and plays with people, just so everyone loses it when they don&#39;t see it coming.&quot;

&quot;Well I know a guy from Philly you might get along with if this falls through.&quot; Oliver chuckled.

&quot;I hope you&#39;re not talking about that living pit stain you call Brody,&quot; Tipper groaned.

&quot;Him? Of course not!&quot; Oliver then looked to Vincent and mouthed //&quot;I am totally talking about that guy!&quot;//

Vincent decided not to entertain this bitter feud and moved on to the next contestant. He was a male with short, light blond hair and pale skin. He was wearing a sky blue shirt, and appeared to be a human but with two large, soft blue wings behind his back. His eyes were closed, and he had a neutral, peaceful expression.

&#39;&#39;Saul
$o[minty2mayhem]&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;I was surprised that someone like Saul would want to compete on a reality show, but maybe that&#39;s a reason he signed up for this series in particular.&quot;] Vincent gave a half-shrug. $v[&quot;Saul&#39;s biggest strength is his ability to manage stress, which he hopes will serve him well in the competition. He frequently has visions, and although they tend to be vague, he says, they might give him a leg up in determining whether he&#39;s going along the right track.&quot;]

&quot;I see,&quot; said Tipper. &quot;I&#39;m hoping he turns out to be the proactive type. If he doesn&#39;t get caught up in the hustle and bustle of the game, and he does nothing to change how it plays out, then he might as well not be playing at all.&quot;

Oliver nodded. &quot;He looks like the quiet type, though... but I&#39;m going to hold out hope.&quot;

Vincent pressed the button on his clicker, revealing the second-to-last castaway. She was a young anthro rabbit with gray fur and dark green eyes. She was wearing a black t-shirt with a white outline of two dice on it. She was smiling brightly.

&#39;&#39;Tara Grey
$q[minty2mayhem]&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Tara is a friendly, outgoing girl who likes to show off,&quot;] explained Vincent. $v[&quot;Her hobby is magic, and she hopes that she can impress her team to help form initial relationships with them. She knows she&#39;s not the strongest player, but she wants to make up for it in charisma and a little sass.&quot;]

&quot;I have a feeling she&#39;s going to be the underdog type who gets by through being a positive force on her team that everyone wants to be friends with,&quot; Tipper suggested. &quot;I don&#39;t know if she&#39;ll able to avoid being seen as dangerous if she depends on this strategy too much.&quot;

&quot;The only way I can see someone so positive getting eliminated early is if she&#39;s on a tribe of complete jerks.&quot; Oliver nodded. &quot;I am hoping that isn&#39;t the case because I am sure she can be a really rootable player if she can make it far enough… yes she&#39;s also a top contender for me.&quot; he smiled.

$v[&quot;And that brings us to the last contestant of the season,&quot;] said Vincent. He pressed the button on his clicker, and the TV screen flashed red.

&quot;Wait, what&#39;s happening?&quot; Tipper asked.

&quot;Oh god....&quot; Oliver stood up from his chair looking hella scared right now.

$v[&quot;That&#39;s weird,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;This calls for some percussive maintenance.&quot;] He stood up from his chair, walked over to the TV and smacked it once with the clicker.

The screen returned to its normal colours, but the final castaway was only a black silhouette...

...but it cleared up to reveal a man in his mid-twenties with short brown hair, glasses, and a five o&#39;clock shadow. He was wearing a bright blue shirt, and his green eyes showed how anxious he was.

&#39;&#39;Václav Beránek
$q[minty2mayhem]&#39;&#39;

&quot;Oh, thank goodness...&quot; Oliver sighed in relief. &quot;Just some kid who looks like he wet himself.&quot;

$v[&quot;Oliver, sit down,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;Václav is an intelligent man who sometimes gets caught up in his ideas, good or bad. He says he is prepared for the strategic aspect of the game, but he has to be wary of his tendency to overthink things, but my worry is that he&#39;s going to be more concerned of literally everything else. Václav might be a huge threat if he would just take a deep breath once in awhile.&quot;]

&quot;Looks like he&#39;s going to be a complete disaster,&quot; said Tipper. &quot;However, where he differs from Sly is that Václav looks like he has a backbone, so he isn&#39;t doomed to goat status, and might even get targeted for simply having a good day.&quot;

&quot;Well now I feel bad for saying that aboot him.&quot; Oliver frowned. &quot;I hope he does manage to find his way in this crazy game somehow, and if he doesn&#39;t win I hope he can at the very least grow from the experience.&quot;

Vincent clicked his clicker one last time, revealing the cast of 18 sitting and standing on the steps of what appeared to be a temple of some kind.

$v[&quot;So, any thoughts, questions, concerns?&quot;] said Vincent.

&quot;Yeah, are these actual ancient ruins or just props?&quot; Tipper asked. &quot;I really hope you guys aren&#39;t romping around in places with historical and archaeological value.&quot;

$v[&quot;No comment. Oliver, any questions?&quot;] Vincent asked, slightly annoyed.

&quot;A few, will there be any special gimmicks, twists, advantages distributed this season?&quot; asked the purple clad Canadian.

$v[&quot;Actually yes,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;Right out the gate, each tribe is presented with a choice that will have an impact on whether their tribe is truly successful. We&#39;re also bringing back two big twists to make this game a truly hectic experience - kidnapping, and One World. We even have another twist that wasn&#39;t even planned by production!&quot;]

&quot;Wow.&quot; Oliver said, his interest piqued. &quot;I look forward to see what kind of shake ups you have in store for this season.&quot; He gave a thumbs-up.

&quot;What is this twist you didn&#39;t plan?&quot; Tipper asked.

$v[&quot;If we told you, then it wouldn&#39;t be as surprising to you as it was to us,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;You&#39;ll have to wait and see. Anything else you wanted to ask?&quot;]

&quot;Yes, when will this season commence?&quot; Oliver said, looking back up at the full cast picture.

Vincent shrugged.

&quot;Well then, let&#39;s see how it plays out! I am eager to see how the game goes!&quot; Oliver nodded in approval.

&quot;Yeah, me too, surprisingly enough,&quot; said Tipper.

$v[&quot;That&#39;s good to hear, I&#39;m glad that you&#39;re on board,&quot;] Vincent said, smiling. $v[&quot;Thanks for coming out, guys, I appreciate it.&quot;]

&quot;Anytime,&quot; said Tipper. Oliver nodded in agreement.

$v[&quot;Well, hopefully you at home will enjoy the season as well,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;You know what they say, third time&#39;s the charm, right?]

&#39;&#39;An Hour Later&#39;&#39;

The TV was off, as were all the lights. The room was completely empty, as Vincent had returned to his office, and Tipper and Oliver had headed home.

A green wormhole materialized on the wall, and with a loud boom, a familiar-looking man in green stepped out holding a tray of four coloured drinks.

$crazy[&quot;I got everyone slurpees!&quot;] cRaZy exclaimed. $crazy[&quot;I know you said you didn&#39;t want any, but deep down I knew-&quot;]

He realized he was alone in the room, and his face immediately dropped.
