Small rainclouds race through the sky as the sun emerges from behind the jungle canopy, illuminating the vibrant landscape.

A blond-haired &lt;span class=&#39;secretlink&#39;&gt; (link: &quot;French Canadian&quot;)[Québécois]&lt;/span&gt; man with a blue jacket and Capri pants admires the view from atop one particularly high foothill.

$v[&quot;Such a beautiful sight, isn&#39;t it?&quot;] He turns to face the camera. $v[&quot;We&#39;re here in the Andean mountains of Peru, right before the hills give way to the Amazon rainforest below and away. The crossroads of high and low, of wet and dry. And now, co-operation and competition.&quot;]

A shot of the challenge area is shown. There are walls enclosing an elevated plateau atop one foothill, with a single path leading in. Three banners flutter in the wind opposite the entrance – $q[one a dark indigo], $o[one a medium green], $c[and one a light pink].

$v[&quot;Here, 18 castaways from all walks of life will come to brave the elements, and each other, to see who is worthy of the title of Sole Survivor. They are playing here, in what was once part of the eastern edge of the great Inca Empire, which for a century was the most prominent civilization this side of the Atlantic. They succeeded without so many of the necessities that were taken for granted in the civilizations of Europe, Asia, and Africa... and this season&#39;s castaways are here to do the same.&quot;]



&#39;&#39;SURVIVOR: INCA LEGACY&#39;&#39;



$v[&quot;We have an exciting season planned for you all, with a number of secrets in store to keep both the players and you at home on your toes,&quot;] says Vincent. He smiles. $v[&quot;So without any further delay, let&#39;s get started. Eighteen castaways... 39 days... one Sole Survivor!&quot;]

Challenge Beach**

Vincent is standing at one side of the challenge beach, with three coloured banners fluttering behind him in the harsh wind.

$v[&quot;Here we are, in the highlands of Peru!&quot;] he calls out, to be heard above the wind. $v[&quot;Any minute now, eighteen contestants from all walks of life will come together to compete in what should be the adventure of a lifetime.&quot;]

The camera switches to a montage of footage of various rainforest animals, including brightly-coloured frogs and a monkey or two. Then, driving between trees on a narrow path, an off-road vehicle is shown carrying six players riding in the back. The camera zooms in on one in particular, a thin girl with brown hair and eyes, pale skin, and a form-fitting red top.

//&quot;I&#39;ve been watching this show since before I knew how to spell its name,&quot; says Denine. She is sitting down in the sand. &quot;I think I have what it takes to go far, and I can only hope that I have fun doing it.&quot;//

Next, as footage of mountains and alpacas plays, Vincent continues. $v[&quot;Peru was once the core to the Inca Empire, one of the greatest civilizations in the Americas. Their empire thrived with few of the advantages enjoyed by those in the Old World, and this season we&#39;re giving our cast even less to work with.&quot;]

The shot switches to show a helicopter flying high above the hills and mountains. Inside, another six competitors sit, watching as they approach their home for at least the next three days, or as many as thirty-nine. A tall, blonde woman with a pink dress and a silver purse leans against the window, looking up at the clouds they are skirting under.

//&quot;Okay, so like it&#39;s going to be really weird not having the basics, like running water, ice machines, that kind of thing? Stuff everyone takes for granted.&quot; Ashleia sighs. &quot;But I&#39;m not, like, weak, okay? I don&#39;t back down from a good challenge.&quot;//

Then, footage of narrow, winding rivers is shown, with a variety of tropical fish and other aquatic wildlife in close-up shots. The shot then shows a speedboat that has reached the challenge beach. As Vincent watches the six competitors climb out of the boat, helping each other with their belongings, he speaks up again. $v[&quot;We have divided the cast into three tribes of six, groups they will need to depend on to survive.]

The final group walks over to Vincent and the tribe mats and banners. They make their way over to the deep indigo mat and stand on it. The camera focuses on the oldest member of the group, a middle-aged, heavyset man with graying hair, as he turns his head to spit on the ground.

//&quot;Well, it ain&#39;t exactly a vacation, that&#39;s for sure,&quot; says Monty, sitting on a log. &quot;But laying down and drinking fruity cocktails ain&#39;t my idea of a good time either. I work hard, and I play hard.&quot;//

Once the other two tribes arrived, Vincent clears his throat and speaks up again.

$v[&quot;Welcome to Survivor: Inca Legacy! The eighteen of you are about to begin the adventure of a lifetime.&quot;] Vincent looks over the cast briefly before looking one of them in the eyes. $v[&quot;Man in the sports jersey, what&#39;s your name?]

&quot;Jarrett,&quot; responds a young man with black hair and a dark complexion. He is sporting a red, blue, and white basketball jersey.

$v[&quot;You haven&#39;t had the opportunity to talk to your tribe yet, but are you already getting impressions from them, and maybe some of those around you?&quot;]

&quot;In a way,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;We&#39;ve been in a helicopter for a little while, so mostly it&#39;s just been seeing each other looking each other over. In my mind at least, the only thing I&#39;ve gotten is that everyone is as interested in finding out what makes me tick as much as I want to know what makes them tick.&quot;

$v[&quot;Interesting,&quot;] says Vincent with a smile. $v[&quot;You, woman in the light blue shirt, what&#39;s your name?&quot;]

&quot;Lisa.&quot;

$v[&quot;Have you had any more luck than Jarrett?&quot;] A few contestants chuckled at this.

&quot;Well, to me it looks like we have an intriguing group,&quot; says Lisa with a bit of a blush, &quot;and I look forward to the pleasure of acquainting myself with them all!&quot;

$v[&quot;Well, Lisa, here&#39;s your first chance to see how you and your tribe will get along.&quot;] Vincent holds three slips of paper in his hand, and he waves them in front of him. $v[&quot;In my hand are notes containing clues to all three hidden immunity idols, as well as a clue to another secret advantage. Each tribe will get one to share... unless they choose to give it up for something that can help them in another way.&quot;] He steps to the side, revealing three rolled-up tarps. One is a purple colour, one is green, and one is white. $v[&quot;You can choose to give up this note in exchange for a tarp. It may not help you strategically, but this will keep you warm and dry at night, and it might protect your tribe so you&#39;ll never even need these clues. Now, you all have a few minutes to discuss with your tribe whether you want the note or the tarp.&quot;]

A young woman with brown hair brushed to one side and wearing a denim jacket steps forward off the light pink mat. &quot;We&#39;re going to take the tarp.&quot;

Vincent raises his eyebrows, watching the other two tribes huddle out of the corner of his eye. $v[&quot;Sorry, what&#39;s your name?&quot;]

&quot;My name&#39;s Jennifer,&quot; she replies.

$v[&quot;Are you sure you want to speak for your tribe on this?&quot;]

Jennifer nods. &quot;A tarp will help all of us, an idol will only help one of us and lead to division in our tribe. We need the tarp.&quot;

Vincent passes the white tarp over to Jennifer. $v[&quot;Jennifer, you and the five people behind you are now the] $c[Chalpe Tribe]$v[. Your tarp comes with a map to your camp, and a small kit of the necessities needed to start off strong.&quot;]

After a brief discussion, Jarrett steps off the green mat. &quot;We&#39;re going to take the tarp. We can all use the tarp, we can&#39;t all use the idol.&quot;

Behind him, an anthropomorphic skunk wearing a leather jacket speaks up. &quot;Dude, Jennifer literally just said that.&quot;

$v[&quot;Regardless,&quot;] says Vincent, $v[&quot;Jarrett, you and your five teammates are now the] $o[Ochora Tribe]$v[. You will start off with the same supplies as Chalpe.&quot;] He passes the green tarp over to Jarrett.

After a much longer debate, eventually a college-aged woman with bronze-coloured skin and dark brown hair steps off the indigo mat. &quot;Vincent, we&#39;re going to take the tarp as well.&quot;

$v[&quot;Alright, what&#39;s your name?&quot;] Vincent asks.

&quot;Paula,&quot; she replies.

$v[&quot;Paula, so you are also taking the tarp. May I ask why?&quot;]

&quot;Because anyone who wants to take the clue is going to incur the suspicion of our entire tribe, so we want to take away that temptation.&quot;

Behind her, a woman of the same age with bright blonde hair and a red and black plaid jacket shakes her head.

$v[&quot;Plaid jacket woman, is there something wrong?&quot;] Vincent asks.

&quot;I just don&#39;t think that&#39;s true,&quot; she replies. &quot;The whole tribe can use an idol if we stick together. And if we make a good enough shelter we don&#39;t need a tarp.&quot;

&quot;I really don&#39;t think your scenario is likely,&quot; says Monty.

&quot;Well, don&#39;t come crying to me if you guys are outnumbered at the merge.&quot;

Vincent passes the purple tarp to Paula. $v[&quot;Well, time to see whether your prediction comes true. You guys are the ]$q[Quibas Tribe]$v[. And now that you all have the tarps, your decision has been locked in.&quot;] He rips up the three notes. $v[&quot;You can now head off to your new home. Best of luck.&quot;]

$c[**Chalpe**]

The six members of the tribe arrive at their tribe camp. Jennifer is leading the way, holding the map, having relegated the tribe map to someone else. Their camp is an open field with short grass on a gentle slope. They have a well, but no open water in sight.

&quot;Well, we&#39;re here,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;Any objections to me taking charge so we can get this tribe rolling?&quot;

Nobody says anything.

&quot;Alright.&quot; Jennifer folds up the map and tucks it into her bag. &quot;I don&#39;t really see any of us being all-stars in the strength department, so I think we should all pitch in for building the shelter.&quot;

//&quot;Leadership is in my blood,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;But to come out and say &#39;hi, I&#39;m Jennifer, here to boss you all around&#39; would be a death sentence. So, I gotta be careful with my word choice. I need to be approachable if I want to succeed.&quot;//

&quot;We should split up so we can look for supplies in more places, though,&quot; says a man with shoulder-length dirty blond hair and a purple and blue plaid jacket.

&quot;Good idea,&quot; Jennifer replies. &quot;I&#39;ll go this way, you go that way, the rest of you just follow one of us.&quot;

&quot;Just stick to the trails, you don&#39;t know what&#39;s lurking out here,&quot; adds the plaid-shirted man.

//&quot;We may be in the jungles, but it&#39;s not always the wild that you have to worry about,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;Sometimes the biggest dangers are hiding in human skin. ...That sounded less creepy in my head. I mean watch your back, not watch out for the wendigo.&quot;//

Rhett and Lisa walk down one path alongside a college-aged man with short blond hair and a gray and blue t-shirt.

&quot;I am positively elated to be out here,&quot; Lisa explains cheerfully. &quot;I do believe we will be having a splendid time out here, but I would love to know more about you gentlemen.&quot;

&quot;R-really?&quot; The gray-shirted man asks quietly.

&quot;You don&#39;t have anything to hide, do you?&quot; Rhett asks, raising an eyebrow.

&quot;I don&#39;t, I swear! I just don&#39;t like being put on the spot.&quot;

//&quot;In general, I don&#39;t like people I don&#39;t know,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;I&#39;ve been told I come off as confrontational at times, but I see it as making it clear that my trust needs to be earned. The sooner my tribe realizes I&#39;m not going to bend over backwards for them, the better we can all get along.&quot;//

&quot;I&#39;m a medicine student,&quot; Buddy explains. &quot;I would like to be a doctor someday. Maybe a physician or a surgeon.&quot;

&quot;Aw, that is so wonderful!&quot; says Lisa. &quot;You will touch the hearts of thousands. What about you, Rhett?&quot;

Rhett coughs into his fist. &quot;I don&#39;t like to discuss my personal life in front of the cameras.&quot;

Buddy rolls his eyes. &quot;Where do you think you are? This is reality television, they&#39;re going to hear everything. Didn&#39;t you sign a release form?&quot;

&quot;I forged my signature,&quot; Rhett replies.

&quot;How do you forge your //own// signature?&quot; Buddy asks in disbelief.

Rhett cuts Buddy off. &quot;Lisa, how about you? What do you do?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just a normal girl with big dreams,&quot; Lisa replies. &quot;I&#39;m here to play for my family. Right before I left, my dear father was in a messy car accident... I didn&#39;t get to say goodbye.&quot; She clenches her eyes shut, and says softly, &quot;I&#39;m playing this for my dad.&quot;

&quot;Lisa, I&#39;m... I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;We&#39;re here for you if you need anything, alright?&quot;

//&quot;I&#39;m pleased that we have Buddy, bless his soul, on our tribe,&quot; says Lisa. &quot;I didn&#39;t even have the heart to interrupt him and tell him my dear father is alive and well. He only could not arrive at the airport to wish me well before the plane took off.&quot;//

On the other side, Jennifer is walking with Denine, as well as with a chubby anthropomorphic otter with brown fur, an open blue jacket, and a black and white cap.

&quot;So, I&#39;m one of the rare few that actually appreciates all of the seasons in some way,&quot; says Denine. &quot;Obviously some are better than others, but I don&#39;t think any of them are actually terrible.&quot;

&quot;Wow, not even ---?&quot; Jennifer asks, with the season she believes as terrible being censored.

&quot;Yeah that one sucked,&quot; adds the otter.

&quot;Maybe I&#39;m just a bit of a sadist who likes seeing people miserable.&quot; Denine giggles.

The otter&#39;s eyes widen.

//&quot;I like Denine&#39;s brutal honesty,&quot; says Louie. &quot;She&#39;s determined, and despite her positive demeanour, it doesn&#39;t look like she is going to put up with any crap.&quot;//

&quot;As long as I come out with the million, what happens in between doesn&#39;t really matter,&quot; says Louie. &quot;And if it means crushing some dreams I&#39;ll do it.&quot;

&quot;Well you aren&#39;t going to crush any of mine,&quot; says Denine. &quot;I&#39;m not going down without a fight.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want to see you go down without a fight,&quot; Louie replies.

&quot;Scratch that, I&#39;m not going down.&quot; Denine smirks.

&quot;Nice to see you&#39;re hyped and all,&quot; says Jennifer, &quot;but I hope the two of you can save this for when we have to beat the other tribes.&quot;

Denine nods. &quot;Absolutely. We&#39;re going to crush them.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t make promises you can&#39;t keep,&quot; says Louie.

&quot;I&#39;ll keep that in mind for when I make one,&quot; Denine fires back.

//&quot;Morale is high, we&#39;re working as a team, I&#39;d say we&#39;re doing pretty well,&quot; says Denine. &quot;It&#39;s not going to be this easy, but if you start strong then it&#39;s all the more likely you can finish strong.&quot;//

$o[**Ochora**]

The tribe of six arrives at their new camp. Their camp consists of a plateau atop a small hill. A stream runs along one edge of the camp, and mutiple paths lead away from the camp and the stream. A black-haired woman of Korean descent with glasses and a yellow shirt is holding the map.

&quot;Congratulations, we&#39;ve made it here alive,&quot; she says. &quot;We need to get a shelter built and food collected, since we don&#39;t have flint right now.&quot;

//&quot;We have a tarp, that&#39;s a huge advantage right out of the gate,&quot; says Min-Ji. &quot;We need to make sure we don&#39;t blow it.&quot;//

The tribe divides into two groups. In one group, Ashleia is looking for food, and she is followed by a blonde woman with tan skin and a blue sweater, and a pale blond man with a pair of soft, pastel blue wings.

&quot;So, like, your names are Candace and Saul, right?&quot; Ashleia smiles. &quot;I&#39;m good with names, so I&#39;ll take note of that.&quot;

Saul nods. &quot;Okay, so do you know what we should be doing right now?&quot; he asks.

Ashleia sadly shakes her head. &quot;I know that, like, we should find fruit and stuff since we aren&#39;t eating just rice? But I don&#39;t really know what grows around here. I&#39;m not used to buying fruit that isn&#39;t pre-washed.&quot;

&quot;Have you ever actually seen a fruit outside of the supermarket?&quot; Candace asks.

&quot;Like, of course!&quot; Ashleia responds. &quot;That&#39;s what the kitchen is for!&quot;

//&quot;I&#39;m a bit worried that Ashleia isn&#39;t all there in the head,&quot; says Candace. &quot;Do you know where you are right now? Do you understand the conditions you&#39;re going to be living in? How many fingers am I holding up?&quot;//

Saul looks at a berry bush with a raised eyebrow. &quot;I am wondering if these here are edible.&quot;

&quot;They, like, should be or they wouldn&#39;t be out here, right?&quot; Ashleia asks.

Saul glances over at Ashleia, with a horrified expression on his face.

&quot;What?&quot;

Candace walks over and plucks a berry from the bush. &quot;Hm… it&#39;s interesting. Reminds me of our planet. Blue, round, soft, delicate to the touch. It may heal us or harm us, and we can only discover this by taking it all in.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t understand,&quot; Saul replies.

&quot;We have to eat it to know if it&#39;s safe,&quot; says Candace.

&quot;That might not be the best course of action,&quot; Saul whispers. Candace ignores him and eats the berry.

&quot;How was it?&quot; Ashleia asks.

&quot;It was okay,&quot; says Candace. &quot;If we don&#39;t see the medical team in the next six hours, then they should be fine, right?&quot;

//&quot;I had my first vision of the game while spending time with the blonde girls,&quot; says Saul. &quot;They can be vague, but I try my best to interpret them, so I can use them to help others. Unfortunately, I could only see Candace crouched over a bush in this vision. I hope she has something to use to hold her hair back…&quot;// 

Elsewhere, the rest of the tribe is collecting supplies for building the shelter. Min-Ji is clearing the way with the tribe&#39;s machete, getting the other guys to do most of the carrying.

&quot;Think we have enough for six, now?&quot; Jarrett asks, carrying several logs.
Min-Ji looks at the pile in Jarrett&#39;s arms, and nods. &quot;Between you and Rocky, we definitely have enough. If we find anything on the way back, I&#39;ll take it.&quot;

&quot;Then let&#39;s get a move on,&quot; says Rocky. The skunk gently jerks his head downwards, causing the sunglasses on his head to fall into place over his eyes.

//&quot;Everything&#39;s coming together just the way I wanted it,&quot; Rocky says, flashing a toothy smile. &quot;I&#39;m working on making a good impression with the people on my tribe who look like they&#39;ll be pulling their own weight. I&#39;m not really here for dragging along people who can&#39;t keep up, you see.&quot;//

&quot;So, while we&#39;re away from the others,&quot; Min-Ji asks, &quot;what do you think of the three out picking fruit?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t really think the one in the pink dress is all that savvy,&quot; Jarrett replies. &quot;She seems out of her element.&quot;

&quot;All three of them seem kind of… passive, if you ask me,&quot; Min-Ji adds. &quot;I&#39;m hoping that they&#39;re just nervous since it&#39;s day one. Eventually we all need to get with the program.&quot;

&quot;But if they don&#39;t, then that&#39;s three fewer to worry about.&quot; Rocky chuckles. &quot;We can bin &#39;em like dirty laundry.&quot;

Min-Ji visibly winces at Rocky&#39;s lack of respect. &quot;…right. At least Candace seems to have a decent build, she might be able to help in the strength department.&quot;

Jarrett nods. &quot;We need to minimize losses. We can&#39;t afford to lose more than one person.&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Min-Ji replies. &quot;We don&#39;t want to get targeted after the swap for being intact, though. So, we need to just make sure we don&#39;t start on the wrong foot.&quot;

&quot;Then let&#39;s hope we get a good first challenge.&quot;

//&quot;Min-Ji is fairly bright, I can tell that just by listening to her talk,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;Early game, I think her support is worth having. She seems eager to take on a sort of leadership role as well. I&#39;m willing to back her up there, if only because I don&#39;t want to do that myself.&quot;//

The trio arrives back at camp with their shelter building supplies, and places them down before realizing the others aren&#39;t back yet.

Rocky shrugs. &quot;We might as well get started with the shelter before the others come back.&quot;

Jarrett looks over at Min-Ji. &quot;Where did you put the tarp, by the way?&quot;

Min-Ji gestures to a flat area of the camp, next to some bushes. &quot;Over there, where the shelter should go if you ask me.&quot;

Jarrett nods. &quot;Sounds like a plan.&quot;

//&quot;I think I clicked with Jarrett,&quot; Min-Ji admits. She adjusts her glasses. &quot;The two of us are on the same page as to what we want to do. He&#39;s easy to talk to, and I already feel like we&#39;re going to work well together.&quot;//

$q[**Quibas**]

Paula is climbing up a tree to try and get a better vantage point. &quot;I don&#39;t see anything else up here,&quot; she calls down to her tribemate.

&quot;It was worth a shot,&quot; her tribemate replies, brushing her blonde hair out of her face. Her plaid jacket is wrapped around her waist, revealing a light gray undershirt. &quot;We might have enough for a day or two.&quot;

//Jackie holds her knees with her hands as she leans forward. &quot;Paula and I went to go get some fruit for the tribe, since we were unsure about how long our rice would last. So, I did what any good Survivor player would do and started hinting at working together.&quot;//

&quot;You and me, final two, what do you think?&quot; Jackie asks.

Paula raises her eyebrows. &quot;Already?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I have the perfect plan,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;First we get rid of Monty for being old and therefore weak. Then the purple hood guy, he looks shady. Then we have a girl&#39;s alliance with the rabbit but we turn on her because she can&#39;t help us win immunity. Then we go with the guy with the glasses to the final four, then take him out and whoever&#39;s left. It&#39;s literally foolproof.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s… a lot to process,&quot; Paula replies. &quot;I&#39;ll need a few days to think about this. But in the meantime, you never told me what you do outside the game. Are you a student, are you working, or what?&quot;

&quot;Come on, Paula,&quot; says Jackie flippantly, &quot;we both know you don&#39;t really care.&quot;

&quot;I mean, I would like to get to know someone before I agree to be their final two partner,&quot; says Paula.

&quot;Whatever. Sooner or later, I&#39;m going to need a yes or a no.&quot;

//&quot;I thought this was a social experiment, emphasis on social,&quot; says Paula. &quot;Is it wrong for me to want to think this over? Or is Jackie just playing too hard and looking like an idiot?&quot;//

Monty has recruited another tribe member – a young man with brown hair, glasses, and a five o&#39;clock shadow – to help him build the shelter. They have selected the highest part of their camp to build the shelter and fire pit, knowing the steep hill leading down to a shallow and small lake would be too troublesome to build on.

&quot;You sure you&#39;re a construction worker? I can trust you that this will be stable?&quot; Monty&#39;s new acquaintance asks.

&quot;No reason to lie,&quot; says Monty. &quot;What&#39;s your name again?&quot;

&quot;Vaclav,&quot; replies the younger man.

&quot;Oh,&quot; says Monty. &quot;Sorry. I&#39;m no good with foreign names. Can I call you something like V-Man?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d rather you not,&quot; says Vaclav.

&quot;Okay, V,&quot; Monty replies. He straightens out the tribe&#39;s purple tarp and stretches it over the shelter roof.

//&quot;I don&#39;t even know how I&#39;m supposed to spell that,&quot; says Monty in his thick Southern drawl. &quot;V-A-T-Z-L-O-V? I ain&#39;t got an idea. I don&#39;t speak any European languages.&quot;//

The two tie the tarp on, and then decide to explore around the camp a little. While walking, Vaclav turns to Monty cautiously.

&quot;I-I just think you should know that I&#39;m kind of scared to be out here,&quot; Vaclav sheepishly admits. &quot;Everything here is kind of new to me. Tropical weather, no running water, the whole game component, you know? I&#39;m freaking out internally.&quot;

&quot;You got nothing to worry about in my book,&quot; Monty reassures him. &quot;You&#39;re a strong guy, you should be safe for a while.&quot;

&quot;Please don&#39;t vote me out! I&#39;m not a physical threat!&quot; Vaclav pleads.

&quot;Why would I ever do that, Vad-man?&quot; Monty wonders aloud. &quot;You seem like a good kid. Ease up a bit.&quot; He spits into a rut in the dirt path.

The two continue down a path away from camp. Meanwhile, their other two tribemates are busy assembling a fire pit. One of them, an anthropomorphic rabbit girl, gestures towards the indigo hood being worn by the other.

&quot;So, what&#39;s this for? Are you a druid or something?&quot; she asks.

&quot;Close, but not quite. I&#39;m a ninja.&quot;

&quot;How are ninjas and druids related?&quot;

//Tara scratches her head, right behind one of her long floppy ears. &quot;So the hooded guy, Khall, I kind of got drawn to him because I feel like I&#39;m dwarfed around everyone else besides maybe Paula. I felt more comfortable with him at first. But now I&#39;m learning he&#39;s kind of… weird.&quot;//

&quot;…and then the entire ride came to a screeching halt! I got out of my seat and raced over to see what the problem was,&quot; says Khall.

&quot;Okay, were you allowed to?&quot; Tara asks.

&quot;I don&#39;t remember, but that might be why I ran into those security guards later,&quot; Khall replies. &quot;But anyways. I got right under the nose of the car, and would you believe it – stuck under the left wheel, it was the five of spades!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s actually kind of cool,&quot; says Tara. She smiles. &quot;You know, magic is kind of my thing. I don&#39;t usually do card tricks and stuff though, I get more… advanced than that.&quot;

&quot;Oh, awesome! What am I thinking about right now?&quot; Khall excitedly asks.

&quot;You&#39;re thinking about what I mean by advanced tricks,&quot; Tara replies, a little confused.

&quot;Wow, that&#39;s amazing! How did you know?&quot;

//&quot;I love Tara! She&#39;s like my best friend here,&quot; Khall explains. &quot;We&#39;re both good at bending the fabric of reality, and we both like the colour green! It&#39;s great to be on her tribe, and working with her would be amazing.&quot;//

&quot;Want to see something I can do?&quot; Tara asks. She lifts one paw about five centimeters above a rock. She then raises her paw slowly in the air, and to Khall&#39;s surprise, the rock moves up at the same rate.

&quot;What else can you do? Oh, can you make it into a cactus?&quot; Khall suggests.

Tara&#39;s concentration breaks, and the rock drops back to the ground. &quot;W-what!? I&#39;m sorry, I guess I just didn&#39;t expect you to ask something like that.&quot;

Khall looks down sadly.

&quot;I just can&#39;t make something alive out of something not alive is all,&quot; says Tara. &quot;I mean you&#39;d have to give me some other kind of plant for me to do that.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be right back!&quot; Khall exclaims.

&quot;Oh, no you don&#39;t! We have a fire pit to make still,&quot; says Tara, grabbing onto his green cape. Khall stumbles and falls backwards when he fails to break out of Tara&#39;s grip.

//&quot;I can&#39;t really deny that at the same time Khall seems like a genuine guy, if a little loopy,&quot; says Tara. &quot;And I think I need to start working on getting my head in the game, so maybe working with him wouldn&#39;t be a bad place to start.&quot;//

Tara opens her mouth to ask a question, but Khall places his gloved hand over her mouth.

&quot;I don&#39;t see a problem with voting with you,&quot; says Khall, &quot;but my creator had a character win the last season, so I doubt I&#39;ll be around to help you for very long.&quot;

Tara pushes Khall&#39;s arm back. &quot;I don&#39;t even understand what you&#39;re trying to say here.&quot;

At this point, Monty and Vaclav return to camp. Monty is holding a piece of flint.

&quot;We can get fire now,&quot; says Monty. &quot;Either of you get any leaves or twigs we can start one with?&quot;

&quot;Awesome! Yeah, we have a pile started here. Not sure where the machete went, though,&quot; Tara replies.

//&quot;I didn&#39;t think getting the flint would be that easy,&quot; Vaclav admits, &quot;but it turns out not far from camp was this little place with a bunch of podiums and tribe banners, and there were three pieces of flint. I thought we would need to earn it, but heh, maybe not. I might have to go back and make sure we didn&#39;t miss anything. No stone unturned... or else...&quot; He shudders.//

$c[**Chalpe**]

//&quot;Well, we ran out of time to construct a fire pit,&quot; says Lisa, &quot;but we do have quite the pleasant little abode with a nice white tarp on top! If it rains, fire might not be so urgent, I suppose.&quot;//

Louie was the first to wake up, after having turned in early last night. He tries to sit himself up, but finds more than his overweight frame holding him down. He looks down and notices all five members of his tribe are using his chest and belly as a pillow.

&quot;Get. Off. Me.&quot; He growls, but his plea falls on deaf ears, as nobody stirs to hear him. He sighs.

//&quot;Who needs comfort items when you have Louie?&quot; Buddy chuckles to himself. &quot;Although I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s worth the crotchety old man vibe we all get when he&#39;s awake. So I&#39;m guessing I should enjoy it while he&#39;s still able to resist just pushing us off.&quot;//

Louie&#39;s stomach abruptly rumbles, which quickly makes the other five awaken.

&quot;What the hell was that?&quot; Denine grumbles, wiping her eyes.

&quot;Your warning that if we don&#39;t get some food in the next, I don&#39;t know, two hours, you&#39;re all on my hit list,&quot; Louie replies.

//&quot;No fire so we can&#39;t cook the rice. Nobody bothered to go look for fruit yesterday. You bet I&#39;m pissed,&quot; Louie explains. &quot;I&#39;m not a happy-go-lucky guy, understand? I&#39;m not going to fake a smile just for brownie points with these people.&quot;//

Jennifer and Buddy go off on their own first.

&quot;Alright, so we need to have a good variety of fruits and seeds,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;If we just have a bunch of fruits then we have no protein, and we can&#39;t live on seeds because we aren&#39;t chipmunks.&quot;

&quot;Louie kind of looks like one,&quot; says Buddy.

&quot;One, he&#39;s an otter,&quot; Jennifer replies, &quot;and two, this food is just for the five of us. I bet he can get his own food.&quot;

&quot;And if he can&#39;t, he can stand to go on an emergency diet,&quot; says Buddy.

&quot;Scan the left side of the path for anything that looks edible,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;I&#39;ll handle the right. We can sort it out back at camp and see what won&#39;t poison us.&quot;

//&quot;We&#39;re done with the greetings and the gossip, time to worry about survival,&quot; explains Jennifer. &quot;This tribe I can already tell has either a discipline problem or a superiority complex. If we&#39;re going to be successful, that can&#39;t stand.&quot;//

Buddy looks over at Jennifer. &quot;Do you think this is enough?&quot; He is lifting the bottom of his shirt, so he can hold a sizable amount of berries and seeds in the pocket he has created over his stomach.

&quot;Did you seriously forget to bring a basket?&quot; Jennifer asks, with an eyebrow raised.

&quot;You didn&#39;t give me much time to think about what was going on,&quot; Buddy replies.

Jennifer rolls her eyes. &quot;Just... just put it in mine. It should fit.&quot;

//&quot;Hey, Jen, here&#39;s a tip for you,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;Chill out with the whole power trip stuff. It&#39;s just making me not want to have to listen to your barking orders.&quot;//

Meanwhile, Denine and Rhett are walking together. Denine is walking slightly in front of Rhett, carrying the basket that Buddy forgot.

&quot;You know, I like a guy who&#39;s good with his hands,&quot; says Denine. She raises an eyebrow and smiles.

&quot;I like a girl who knows there&#39;s a time and a place for hookups,&quot; Rhett replies.

&quot;Touché,&quot; Denine says, &quot;but it was worth a shot.&quot;

//&quot;I can&#39;t help that Rhett&#39;s cute, you know,&quot; says Denine. &quot;I didn&#39;t expect to only have two guys I could really try with. I thought I could give Rhett a shot, but I guess I need to win him over the old-fashioned way – small talk.&quot;//

&quot;So what do you like most about Survivor?&quot; Denine excitedly asks.

&quot;I like the concept of many bright minds coming together and putting each other to the test,&quot; Rhett explains. &quot;It&#39;s a bit of a tragedy that it has so often been diluted to the benefit of the more physically fit males, to the detriment of the other players.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, production rigging sucks, but it&#39;s led to some good moments,&quot; Denine replies.

&quot;Production... rigging? They can do that?&quot; Rhett asks, slightly worried.

&quot;Sometimes,&quot; says Denine. &quot;Reality TV is a misnomer.&quot;

&quot;Interesting.&quot; Rhett picks a fruit from a tree, and places it in Denine&#39;s basket. &quot;So, I have a philosophical question for you.&quot;

&quot;Okay, shoot.&quot;

&quot;Do you believe someone can be held responsible for what they do while they are inebriated?&quot; Rhett asks.

Denine, while a little confused, decides to give her honest opinion. &quot;I think so, if they made the decision to consume alcohol. Isn&#39;t that more of a legal question, though?&quot;

&quot;Well, alcohol does remove inhibitions often, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; Rhett replies. &quot;Their actions may reflect what they want to do while sober.&quot;

//&quot;I am pleased to see that Denine was not casted for her looks,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;I think she makes a good debate partner, and I believe she may be a useful ally as well.&quot;//

Lisa is back at camp, keeping an eye on Louie.

&quot;Do not fret, my rotund companion,&quot; says Lisa. &quot;Our tribe is hard at work finding food for us all. Oh, perhaps we could have a soiree to celebrate! That would lift our spirits for the first challenge, I bet. And aren&#39;t they simply delightful occasions?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll pass,&quot; says Louie flatly.

&quot;Oh, Louie, don&#39;t be such a sourpuss!&quot; Lisa replies. &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll enjoy it, even if our company leaves a little to be desired.&quot;

Louie pulls his visor over his eyes.

&quot;Oh, dearie! Are you feeling alright?&quot; Lisa asks. &quot;You aren&#39;t having a migraine, are you?&quot;

&quot;Shut up,&quot; Louie snaps.

//&quot;I&#39;m feeling a bit miffed that Louie is shutting us all out like this,&quot; Lisa admits. &quot;And although I would love to have him in brighter spirits, if he does not open up then eliminating him would not be a hassle.&quot;//

$o[**Ochora**]

Min-Ji is walking by herself, trying to get a little alone time to think.

//&quot;Our tribe is doing okay,&quot; she explains. &quot;We are all getting along, and we don&#39;t have anyone who&#39;s difficult to talk to, save for Rocky. But he&#39;s our sacrificial lamb, so we have five good people who can work together.&quot;//

On her walk, she stumbles across a quaint plaza of sorts. She notices three wide podiums, each bearing a tribe colour. The $o[green] and $c[light pink] podiums each have flint on top, while the $q[indigo] podium has nothing. She walks past the row of eighteen torches at the other side of the plaza and inspects the area.

&quot;This must be the twist,&quot; says Min-Ji. &quot;Some sort of meeting place, I can imagine.&quot; She then notices a small sign near the podiums and decides to read what it says out loud.

&quot;Not all great empires can rule from one throne. The Inca empire was divided into four separate kingdoms, but cooperation between them was vital. In the same way, the **Town Square** has been provided to you to mingle with the other tribes.&quot;

//&quot;Right when I thought everything was going well, here comes a curveball,&quot; says Min-Ji. She sighs. &quot;The problem is, what use is this twist when we don&#39;t have any allies on the other side? Should I tell the others about this?&quot;//

Min-Ji eventually decides to leave the flint where it is and return to camp.

//&quot;I couldn&#39;t risk it. It&#39;s a little too early. We need to focus on ourselves first, and as long as it stays dry we might not need the flint quite yet. Knock on wood.&quot;//

Back at camp, Jarrett is chatting with Ashleia and Candace.

&quot;So, has Min-Ji talked to either of you guys about tribe leadership or anything like that?&quot; Jarrett asks.

&quot;Anyone may be appointed a leader,&quot; says Candace, &quot;but true leadership comes from within. She must ask herself if she wants to be a true guide, or merely a tyrant.&quot;

Jarrett raises an eyebrow.

&quot;Um, I guess that wasn&#39;t a good berry,&quot; says Ashleia.

&quot;The berry was fine,&quot; Candace assures her. &quot;Besides, Rocky already ate like twelve and he&#39;s still conscious.&quot;

//&quot;I consider myself someone who&#39;s in touch with the world,&quot; explains Candace. &quot;I do feel like sometimes I have to pour my soul out, in the hopes that I can help others obtain a sort of... nirvana. It&#39;s a sort of inner poetry.&quot;//

&quot;I mean, I think she could be leader if she wants to,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;She hasn&#39;t really done anything wrong yet.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s my reasoning as well,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;Candace, anything to add?&quot;

&quot;Not especially,&quot; says Candace. &quot;Kind of distracted at the moment.&quot;

&quot;What did I just say?&quot; Jarrett asks.

&quot;Candace, anything to add?&quot; Candace replies.

//&quot;I thought Ashleia was going to be the difficult one to work with,&quot; Jarrett explains, &quot;but Candace is on another level. She&#39;s letting the game just flow around her. She needs to get serious.&quot;//

Ashleia manages to get Jarrett alone afterwards for a one-on-one talk.

&quot;Okay, Jarret, like, I think you know what you&#39;re doing and all,&quot; Ashleia explains. &quot;Can we maybe, like, work together for now? I just don&#39;t want to be left out because of, like, first impressions and stuff. I know I can help you, I&#39;m not an idiot.&quot;

Jarrett pretends to think it over for a few seconds, before nodding. &quot;Alright, sounds good to me. We can team up.&quot;

&quot;Thank you so much,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;This is, like, something I promise you won&#39;t regret!&quot;

//&quot;I&#39;m, like, not really used to working with men. I don&#39;t have the best history with them since a lot of them see me, like, as less of a person just because I&#39;m pretty and stuff,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;But, like, here I&#39;m going out on a limb and talking to Jarrett because I don&#39;t have much choice. I hope it, like, works out.&quot;//

Min-Ji arrives back at camp to notice Saul struggling with making a fire, and Rocky sitting nearby watching. Saul is trying his hardest to rub two sticks together.

&quot;Just give up, it&#39;s not happening,&quot; says Rocky.

&quot;I want to help this tribe, and in the absence of flint, this is my preferred course of action,&quot; Saul replies.

&quot;Pfft, you&#39;re just tiring yourself out.&quot; Rocky leans forward. &quot;Those sticks are bigger than your forearms, you&#39;re not getting any kind of friction here.&quot;

&quot;Would you like to try?&quot; Saul asks.

&quot;What do you think I was doing for the past three hours?&quot; Rocky counters.

&quot;Air guitar,&quot; says Saul.

//&quot;I sense an unpleasant aura from Rocky, and he makes little effort to mask it,&quot; Saul explains. &quot;It is one of arrogance, entitlement, and associated behaviours. I am doing what I can to counteract this, for the good of the tribe.&quot;//

&quot;Rocky, lay off him, at least he&#39;s trying,&quot; says Min-Ji.

&quot;It&#39;s no use unless we have flint,&quot; Rocky replies. &quot;It&#39;s not my fault he&#39;s using up his strength on a lost cause.&quot;

&quot;I wish we had flint too,&quot; says Min-Ji. &quot;But life doesn&#39;t always work like that. Suck it up, kid.&quot;

//&quot;What did I even do to her?&quot; Rocky asks. &quot;Heck, what did I do to anyone!? I&#39;ve just been trying to help out and make sure we don&#39;t waste our energy.&quot;//

$q[**Quibas**]

Monty and Paula are crouched by the lakeshore, collecting water to boil.

&quot;So we&#39;re supposedly that close to the other camps? And they didn&#39;t tell us about this at the start?&quot; Paula makes a concerned hum. &quot;What an odd way to treat a game changing twist.&quot;

&quot;It ain&#39;t no big deal,&quot; Monty replies. &quot;Just a twist is all.&quot;

&quot;You know what this reminds me of?&quot; Paula says, standing up. &quot;Not sure why I thought of this. But walking through the woods behind my house. I live at the edge of a small forestry town, and there&#39;s this neat little campground not too far a walk from the backyard. It&#39;s where I used to chill with my friends in my elementary years, before we knew about vodka coolers.&quot; She chuckles.

&quot;No way, you&#39;re from the country too?&quot; Monty smiles. &quot;Well, I didn&#39;t expect that from someone so... so...&quot;

&quot;Just say it,&quot; Paula teases.

&quot;Hispanic.&quot;

&quot;W-HUH?&quot;

&quot;Oh, um, is that not the word you use anymore?&quot; Monty asks.

&quot;What does that have to do with me living in the country!?&quot; Paula replies.

//&quot;Good going, you dolt,&quot; says Monty. &quot;You made the girl uncomfortable. I gotta make it up to Paula, this ain&#39;t how I wanted to start things with her.&quot;//

&quot;I thought y&#39;all lived in cities or something, my bad,&quot; says Monty sheepishly.

&quot;I suggest you keep quiet for a while, so you don&#39;t dig yourself deeper,&quot; Paula replies.

&quot;That&#39;s a good idea,&quot; Monty mumbles.

&quot;I hope you haven&#39;t been saying that kind of stuff to anyone else,&quot; says Paula. &quot;Is that why Jackie wants to vote you out?&quot;

Monty raises an eyebrow. &quot;I barely even talked to her. But that ain&#39;t no problem to me. We can sort that out if we lose, you know?&quot;

//&quot;I don&#39;t think he meant to do that,&quot; says Paula. &quot;So, I decided to give him another chance, and even tip him off about Jackie because she&#39;s being kind of a game-obsessed psycho. I would love to have time to get my bearings, so having those two against each other isn&#39;t the worst thing in the world I suppose.&quot;//

The pair returns to camp, where Khall and Jackie are sitting.

&quot;Wow, we sure got a lot of water to boil so we don&#39;t go thirsty,&quot; Monty says loudly. &quot;It feels great to help out the tribe.&quot;

&quot;Um, yeah, I guess,&quot; Paula replies.

Monty walks over to Khall. &quot;Hey Khall,&quot; he says, so Jackie will hear him, &quot;don&#39;t you think it&#39;s great that we&#39;re doing all this work around camp?&quot;

Jackie scowls.

//&quot;Oh you&#39;ve got to be kidding,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;He does ONE thing good, and he wants to rub it in our faces. Newsflash, anyone can do that!&quot;//

Jackie then pulls Tara aside. &quot;Tara, listen, we need to be in an alliance.&quot;

&quot;Why do you say that?&quot; Tara asks.

&quot;Paula must have told Monty that I want him out, so now she&#39;s kind of against us. We need to stick together and bring in Khall and Vaclav, so we have the majority,&quot; Jackie replies quickly.

&quot;Let&#39;s not be too hasty,&quot; says Tara.

&quot;Do you want the game to pass you by?&quot; Jackie asks. &quot;Or do you want to take control and be respected?&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind working with you, but you don&#39;t have to be so intense,&quot; says Tara.

//&quot;I just don&#39;t want it to be Khall or me,&quot; says Tara. &quot;So if Jackie wants to side with us, that&#39;s good for me, even if she&#39;s, you know, Jackie.&quot;//

&quot;Well, now that we&#39;re allies we need to figure out what we do if we ever lose,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;Like right now anything&#39;s fine with me because everyone else here sucks.&quot;

&quot;I thought you liked Paula,&quot; Tara replies.

&quot;I can&#39;t trust Paula right now,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;If she can&#39;t see that working with Monty is a bad idea, then that&#39;s her problem. You and I, we&#39;re the only ones that matter right now.&quot;

&quot;So, um, can we possibly vote out Vaclav if we lose?&quot; Tara asks. &quot;If you and I are together, and Paula and Monty are, and I can get Khall with us, then he&#39;s kind of the outsider.&quot;

&quot;Um, why him and not Monty?&quot; Jackie asks.

&quot;He just seems like a nervous wreck, and I don&#39;t want him to, you know, tank us by accident,&quot; explains Tara.

//&quot;Monty just... sucks,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;I know he hasn&#39;t really done anything wrong, and he&#39;s been nothing but nice and helpful, and he helped build the shelter and made the fire, but he&#39;s just... he sucks. I want to get rid of him, with or without Tara&#39;s help.&quot;//

Later in the day, Paula has a conversation with Khall and Tara.

&quot;I&#39;ve seen you two sticking together,&quot; says Paula. &quot;Just friends, I take it?&quot;

&quot;Pretty much,&quot; says Khall. &quot;Any reason why you called us here? No wait, you didn&#39;t call us here, it just felt appropriate to say that.&quot;

&quot;Paula, we want you to vote out Vaclav with us,&quot; says Tara. &quot;I&#39;m concerned about him.&quot;

&quot;I can see why, I guess,&quot; says Paula. &quot;He&#39;s always skittish. But Monty&#39;s assured me that he&#39;s fine.&quot;

&quot;We kind of have to,&quot; says Tara. &quot;I think we&#39;re the most stable ones here, so- Khall what are you doing.&quot;

Paula and Tara look over to see Khall making a balloon animal out of a spare glove.

&quot;Right, stable,&quot; says Paula.

&quot;Okay, just us two then, and Khall&#39;s our extra vote,&quot; says Tara.

&quot;That&#39;s more accurate,&quot; says Khall.

//&quot;Gee, I hope this comic relief is working, or else I&#39;m just detracting from a crucial scene,&quot; says Khall.//

&quot;So, if Jackie is voting Monty, then the three of us can control the vote,&quot; says Paula. &quot;I&#39;ll have to think about it.&quot;

&quot;I, um, I was told you guys were talking about me.&quot;

Khall steps to the side to allow Vaclav into the conversation.

&quot;We weren&#39;t,&quot; says Paula. &quot;We&#39;re just talking about the food situation. By the way, have you found anything recently? I came across this one tree thataway, but I didn&#39;t get to see if it was growing anything good.&quot;

&quot;I can check that out for you.&quot; Vaclav nods and walks away, but quietly ducks into a nearby bush when nobody was looking in his direction.

//&quot;You don&#39;t need to be all hush hush when talking about the food!&quot; Vaclav protests. &quot;I wasn&#39;t going to let them get away that easily. I just knew they were plotting to get me out.&quot;//

Tara, however, can sense that Vaclav hadn&#39;t actually left the scene. She smiles playfully and turns to Paula. &quot;So, did Khall tell you I was a magician?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think he did,&quot; says Paula.

&quot;Well, most of it is my ability to turn things into other things,&quot; Tara explains.

&quot;Except into cactuses,&quot; says Khall, crossing his arms. He looked to be pouting, but it was impossible to read facial expressions under the unnatural darkness beneath his hood.

&quot;Moving on. Vaclav kind of reminds me of a skittish little squirrel,&quot; says Tara.

&quot;I don&#39;t like the sound of this,&quot; says Paula.

&quot;Relax, it would be mostly painless,&quot; Tara replies. &quot;But yeah, you get it. Making the body conform to the mind and all.&quot;

&quot;But why would you do something like that?&quot; Khall asks, incredulously.

&quot;I try not to. It may be fun, but it&#39;s not worth it,&quot; says Tara. &quot;Unless I have a good reason.&quot;

&quot;What kind of reason?&quot; Khall asks, scratching his head.

Tara sticks out her tongue. &quot;Wait and see.&quot;

Vaclav&#39;s eyes go wide. He tries to cover his mouth with his hands without rustling the bush.

//&quot;Well I didn&#39;t know that much about Tara,&quot; says Paula with a shrug. &quot;But she seems pleasant and sweet enough that this side of her shouldn&#39;t be worrisome. ...Right?&quot;//

Immunity Challenge**

Everyone competes. First, one member at a time has to go out and untie a bag of puzzle pieces from underneath a buoy in a lake. There are four bags in total. The fifth person will have to solve a puzzle that gives a sixth person the combination to a locked box, with the trick being the combination is made of various letter-like symbols instead of letters, numbers, or shapes. When the sixth person unlocks the box, they will use the machete inside to cut a small rope that will unfurl their tribe&#39;s banner. First tribe to release their tribe&#39;s banner wins fishing gear, and the last tribe to do so will vote someone out.

ORDER:
First bag: $c[Jennifer], $o[Jarrett], $q[Tara]
Second bag: $c[Rhett], $o[Min-Ji], $q[Monty]
Third bag: $c[Denine], $o[Candace], $q[Paula]
Final bag: $c[Louie], $o[Rocky], $q[Vaclav]
Puzzle: $c[Lisa], $o[Saul], $q[Jackie]
Locked box: $c[Buddy], $o[Ashleia], $q[Khall]

Chalpe edges to an early lead as Jennifer has little trouble, while both Jarrett and Tara have trouble in the water
Jennifer retrieves her bag and tags in Rhett, who closes in as his opponents continue to struggle
Tara then retrieves her bag and tags in Monty, just as Rhett and Jarrett find their bags
Rhett and Jarrett tag in Denine and Min-Ji respectively. Min-Ji does better than Jarrett did, but Denine is an experienced swimmer and handily beats Min-Ji to the bags
Denine finds her bag and swims back while Monty continues having issues and Min-Ji panics while trying to make up for lost time
Denine tags in Louie, who is an even faster and more graceful swimmer than Denine
Monty and Min-Ji both manage to find their bags before Louie, and begin the swim back
Louie finds Chalpe&#39;s last bag, and swims back to the beach. He is unable to catch up with Min-Ji, but he delivers the last bag before Monty tags in Paula
Lisa opens up all four bags and gets to work on the puzzle
Candace has trouble holding her breath, allowing Paula to catch up and tag in slightly faster than Candace
Lisa is halfway done her puzzle when Paula tags in Vaclav
Vaclav surprises his tribe by delivering on his promises to not freak out in the water, actually making good time. However, Rocky is a better swimmer and puts Ochora back in second place
Lisa completes her puzzle, and while she doesn&#39;t recognize the symbols, she explains them as clearly as they can to Buddy
Rocky manages to get his bag out with no trouble, but Vaclav - having left his glasses with Jackie - has issues with depth perception in the water
Rocky manages to deliver the last bag, but it&#39;s too late - Buddy manages to unlock the box
Saul begins opening the bags while Buddy takes the machete and lets the $c[Chalpe] banner unfurl
$c[Chalpe wins immunity and fishing supplies!]
Vaclav unties his bag as Saul works on the puzzle, swimming back and delivering the last puzzle bag to Jackie
Jackie quietly gets to work on her puzzle, occasionally looking over at the cool and collected Saul
To Jackie&#39;s surprise, she finishes the puzzle first, and begins telling Khall what symbols she sees.
Saul takes a minute or two after Jackie finished to finish himself, and proceeds to give directions to Ashleia
Jackie gets frustrated with Khall misinterpreting her directions, and repeats herself instead of clarifying for him
Ashleia, meanwhile, asks Saul more specific questions when she&#39;s confused (instead of simply saying she doesn&#39;t understand, like Khall)
Eventually, Ashleia unlocks the box before Jackie and Khall make much progress.
Jackie annoyedly blames the rest of her tribe for sucking as Ashleia unfurls the $o[Ochora] banner
$o[Ochora wins immunity!]
$q[Quibas loses, and will have to vote someone out at tribal council]

$v[Vincent asks the] $q[Quibas] $v[tribe to kidnap one member of the] $c[Chalpe] $v[tribe to join them at Tribal Council. They will have individual immunity and be able to vote.]
The Quibas tribe has no idea who anyone is, so Paula picks Buddy on a whim. Her tribe shrugs and agrees.

$c[Buddy] is given a bottle to open at tribal council, and goes with the $q[Quibas Tribe] back to their camp

$q[**Quibas**]

After the challenge, Jackie decides to get Tara and Khall to have an alliance conversation with her.

&quot;Well, Monty took longer on the challenge than Vaclav did,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;See what I mean? He&#39;s a liability.&quot;

Tara nods. &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll vote for him this round. Khall, are you in?&quot;

Khall shrugs. &quot;Okay.&quot;

&quot;The two of you better not make me regret this,&quot; says Jackie. She crosses her arms.

&quot;Thanks for being so understanding,&quot; Tara replies flatly.

//&quot;Okay, cool, I&#39;ll vote with you, Jackie,&quot; says Tara. &quot;Now can you stop being so hostile? Please? It&#39;s not healthy.&quot;//

Meanwhile Vaclav is frantically pleading to Monty for survival. Again.

&quot;You gotta take her out, Monty!&quot; Vaclav cries, holding onto Monty&#39;s collar. &quot;She wants to turn me into a squirrel! I heard her! She&#39;s got that strange magic!&quot;

&quot;Well, can she do somethin&#39; like that?&quot; asks a confused Monty.

&quot;I don&#39;t want to chance it!&quot; Vaclav replies. &quot;Plus she&#39;s been talking with Jackie tonight, and Jackie thinks you&#39;re going home 6 to 1.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m in, then,&quot; says Monty. He spits beside him. &quot;I ain&#39;t goin&#39; home this early.&quot;

//&quot;Jackie is a spoiled little girl, and her attitude is one I don&#39;t work with,&quot; Monty explains. &quot;So if she wants me out for not being a twenty-something model boy, then she&#39;s not worth my breath. And Tara may be nice, but she&#39;s picked her side. Too bad it&#39;s the side I don&#39;t like anymore.&quot;//

Buddy is sitting by the fire, not too happy with the idea of being surrounded by a different tribe&#39;s drama when Paula walks over to him and sits down.

&quot;Hi, Buddy,&quot; says Paula. &quot;Can we talk for a second?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s why you kidnapped me, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Buddy replies.

&quot;Well, yeah,&quot; says Paula. &quot;Vaclav and I are going to vote out Tara, and we think Monty is going to join us. We only need your vote to make it four.&quot;

&quot;Why do you want her out?&quot; Buddy asks.

&quot;It&#39;s more Vaclav wants her out than I do,&quot; Paula explains. &quot;He thinks she wants to turn him into a squirrel or something? I think there&#39;s something not all there with him. But Tara&#39;s not very strong, and I&#39;m concerned about if someone is going to call her bluff.&quot;

//&quot;I didn&#39;t expect it to pan out this way, but here we are,&quot; says Paula. &quot;Here I am, counting on someone from another tribe to swing the majority in my favour. Don&#39;t get me wrong, Tara&#39;s a nice girl, but I&#39;d rather lose her than Monty right now.&quot;//

After Paula had left, Jackie decides it&#39;s her turn to try and sway Buddy. &quot;I think you should vote out Monty, with us,&quot; she says.

Buddy raises an eyebrow. &quot;Is that so?&quot;

&quot;Yeah because, like, everyone else wants him out so you&#39;d look bad if you tried to save him,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;And it will determine if you and your tribe are, like, worth trusting.&quot;

&quot;Why should I care what you think about us?&quot; Buddy asks.

&quot;Look, forget it,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;Monty just sucks on a personal level, but he helps us around at camp so if you vote us off over Tara you&#39;re sort of weakening us. Isn&#39;t that what you guys want, anyways?&quot;

&quot;Oh, wow, that&#39;s tempting,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;I&#39;ll have to think it over.&quot;

&quot;You better pick correctly,&quot; Jackie replies. She turns to walk away but stops. &quot;Oh, and by correctly, I mean vote Monty.&quot;

//&quot;I don&#39;t get what kind of tribe would be so fractured on day three that they give me all the power,&quot; Buddy admits. &quot;It&#39;s difficult to wrap my head around. I can vote Tara out, and get rid of a wild card that benefits another tribe short term. But I can also vote out Monty, and that would just serve to make Jackie try and eat the tribe alive. It&#39;s a matter of who here can help me when a swap or merge hits.&quot;//

$v[**Tribal Council**]

The six members of the Quibas tribe, along with Buddy, walk into the tribal council building. This season, it looks like a small temple of sorts, with the insides plastered and renovated to look fresh. Ornate tapestries adorn the walls. The very back of the building has an open roof, to let out smoke from the fire burning by the back wall.

$v[&quot;You can all come forth and ignite your torch from the fire,&quot;] says Vincent. As they do so, he continues: $v[&quot;In this game, fire represents life. When your torch goes out, so do you. Take a seat.&quot;]

The seven contestants sit down in the stools that form a crescent shape in the middle of the room, facing the fire. Buddy sits in the very middle, holding the bottle given to him at the challenge.

$v[&quot;Paula, it felt like progress in that challenge for your tribe was very off and on. Has that influenced your decision at all?&quot;]

&quot;For the most part, not really,&quot; says Paula. &quot;I think for the most part people had already decided which way they were going to vote before the challenge even happened. Mostly it&#39;s just settled on who&#39;s the target for each side.&quot;

$v[&quot;Meaning the two who performed the weakest?&quot;]

&quot;That would make the most sense,&quot; Paula replies. &quot;That&#39;s not the case.&quot;

$v[&quot;Jackie, does this make sense to you?&quot;]

&quot;It makes perfect sense,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;The person leaving tonight has it coming.&quot;

&quot;Monty doesn&#39;t have anything coming,&quot; Vaclav interrupts. &quot;I don&#39;t get why you&#39;re so bent on getting rid of him, but he&#39;s not the worst one here, okay? He&#39;s a good guy!&quot;

&quot;Boring,&quot; says Jackie.

$v[&quot;Vaclav, are you saying you&#39;re voting based on who you think is &#39;worse&#39; than the others?&quot;]

Vaclav nods. &quot;My vote is for my own safety. And not just as in safety from elimination.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not actually in danger, though,&quot; says Khall. &quot;That would be a little too dark, even for this series.&quot;

$v[&quot;Monty,&quot;] Vincent asks, $v[&quot;is this conflict that Vaclav has with someone else on this tribe good for you?]

Monty shakes his head. &quot;No, because I know I don&#39;t deserve to go either way. It don&#39;t change a thing. Our plan is still the same.&quot;

$v[&quot;Paula, do you know what this plan is?&quot;]

&quot;Yes, I do,&quot; says Paula, &quot;but that&#39;s what we&#39;re here to prove, isn&#39;t it? Trial by fire.&quot;

&quot;Honestly, you aren&#39;t doing yourself any favours,&quot; Jackie replies. &quot;You&#39;ve been really wishy washy, how are we supposed to know if you&#39;re with us or against us if you don&#39;t admit to anything?&quot;

&quot;You expected me to commit to a final two alliance on day one,&quot; Paula snaps. &quot;You need to chill out.&quot;

&quot;Well, YOU need to tell me if you&#39;re with me or against me.&quot;

Paula smirks. &quot;I guess that means I&#39;m against you, then, Jackie. You want to play? Let&#39;s play.&quot;

$v[&quot;Tara, how do you see this as someone looking on the outside?&quot;]

&quot;This is affecting all of us,&quot; says Tara. &quot;It&#39;s not just about Monty and Jackie now, but now everything is starting to be coloured in this abrupt war between two sides. It&#39;s not fun. We have our own problems to deal with.&quot; She looks directly at Vaclav while saying this, making him freeze and tense up in his seat.

$v[&quot;Lastly, Buddy, as a member of the Chalpe tribe, how do you deal with something like this? Are you planning to settle the dispute, or ignore it?&quot;]

&quot;Well, since I have immunity, which I want to keep by the way,&quot; says Buddy, &quot;I&#39;m making this vote to benefit myself. Just as I would if this was on my own tribe.&quot;

$v[&quot;Okay then,&quot;] says Vincent. $v[&quot;It is time to vote. Vaclav, you are first.&quot;]

...

Monty reveals his vote to be for **Tara**. &quot;You have a winning spirit. But this is my alliance&#39;s plan, and they&#39;re the ones looking out for me.&quot;

Tara reveals her vote to be for **Monty**. &quot;Sorry that it has to end like this.&quot;

Jackie glares at Paula, who winks and smiles in return.

$v[&quot;Tara. She takes the lead with three votes.&quot;]

Khall and Tara hold hands.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$v[&quot;Monty. Three votes Monty, three votes Tara, one vote left.&quot;]

The entire tribe looks over at Buddy, attempting to figure out how he voted.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$v[&quot;Final vote, and the first $boot is… Tara. You need to bring me your torch.&quot;]

&quot;Oh… I&#39;m sorry, guys, whatever I did,&quot; says Tara, sadly. She gets up, letting go of Khall.

&quot;I&#39;ll miss you,&quot; says Khall.

As Tara grabs her torch, she passes by Khall, and ruffles the top of his hood. &quot;Do well, okay?&quot; She places her torch in front of Vincent.

$v[&quot;Tara, the tribe has spoken.&quot;] He snuffs the gray rabbit&#39;s torch. $v[&quot;It&#39;s time for you to go.&quot;]

Tara silently exits the building with her belongings.

$v[&quot;And on a heavily divided tribe, it appears that a bystander took the fall tonight based on where their loyalties lied,&quot;] says Vincent. $v[&quot;Next time you may kidnap someone with a different agenda, so the game is by no means over for the minority voters. Keep that in mind as you head back to camp.&quot;]
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
//$q[&quot;I really didn&#39;t expect to be the one to get voted out here,&quot; Tara admits. &quot;I guess not everyone sees it coming, though. I shouldn&#39;t have been so passive, I think that&#39;s what got me. I hyped myself up but did nothing about it. But at least I made a friend before I left.&quot;]//

Vincent stops the Quibas tribe before they can get up and leave.

$v[&quot;One more thing. Buddy, I gave you that bottle at the challenge. I&#39;d like you to open it.&quot;]

Buddy nods, takes the cap off the bottle, and removes the note from inside.

&quot;After you have voted off a member of the Quibas tribe,&quot; he reads, &quot;it is time for you to walk down your own road. You will not return to the Quibas camp, and you must part ways with them at the Town Square.&quot;

$v[&quot;You can now head back to camp.&quot;]

&quot;Wow, that was a lot of walking,&quot; says Khall. &quot;It must have been like five minutes to get here, and then it&#39;s another fifteen to get back to camp.&quot;

&quot;Um, yeah,&quot; Paula replies. &quot;There&#39;s a lot of ground we need to cover. What were you expecting?&quot;

&quot;I thought we would be at our camp,&quot; Khall explains, &quot;then a brief few seconds of walking with our torches, and then it&#39;s a smooth transition to nighttime at tribal council.&quot;

&quot;Are you serious? That&#39;s just how they edit the scenes,&quot; says Buddy.

Jackie gives a disappointed look. &quot;Khall, you&#39;re an idiot.&quot;

Khall lowers his head in shame. &quot;Yeah, I know...&quot;

&quot;Well, that tribal was something I don&#39;t want to go through again any time soon,&quot; says Paula. &quot;Can we work together in challenges and not take what just happened personally?&quot;

Khall nods. &quot;I&#39;ll do it for Tara.&quot;

Paula looks expectantly at the other members of the tribe until they each agree as well.

//&quot;That was really nerve-wracking,&quot; explains Paula. &quot;Everything was going so fast, I didn&#39;t have the time to step back and think &#39;okay, am I doing the right thing?&#39; It&#39;s too early to call this a win, we need to see how the five of us can operate.&quot;//

Jackie looks over at Buddy. &quot;So why did YOU vote her out?&quot;

&quot;Why should you care?&quot; Buddy snaps. &quot;It&#39;s too late to do anything about it.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not too late to do anything about the mess you might have just caused,&quot; Jackie replies. &quot;The way I see things, we were all on the same page until around the time you showed up.&quot;

//&quot;The one person on this tribe that I actually trusted here is gone,&quot; says Jackie with a huff. &quot;And it&#39;s total BS the way it happened. If it wasn&#39;t for that stupid kidnapping twist I might have been able to actually vote out Monty. But you know, Buddy&#39;s not on this tribe, so I&#39;m going to needle him about it until I find out the truth.&quot;//

&quot;I didn&#39;t see it that way,&quot; Buddy replies. &quot;There were some people saying pretty much every name except for Paula and Khall. I just let you guys sort things out and then picked a side. It&#39;s that simple.&quot;

&quot;I gave you the perfect reason to not vote out Tara,&quot; says Jackie.

&quot;Perfect for you, maybe,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;Unfortunately, I don&#39;t really give a damn what you want. I voted her out, now you&#39;re going to have to live with it.&quot;

&quot;Fine,&quot; Jackie snaps. &quot;Well, if you&#39;re not going to be helpful, I&#39;m headed back to camp. OUR camp.&quot; She turns back towards the Quibas campsite, clenching her fists.

&quot;I&#39;m going with her, just in case she tries to, you know, vent,&quot; says Vaclav. He chases after Jackie.

Monty then turns to Khall. &quot;I know she was your friend, but V-Man didn&#39;t give us much of a choice. Don&#39;t take this too hard, okay?&quot;

&quot;Just don&#39;t vote me out next,&quot; Khall replies. &quot;Then we should be okay.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re probably the safest one on the tribe right now,&quot; says Paula. She puts a hand on Khall&#39;s shoulder. &quot;This wasn&#39;t an attack on you. You may have liked her, but Vaclav wasn&#39;t the only one worried about her. I got nervous. But keep it together, we want to keep you over Jackie.&quot;

//&quot;So far, everything I thought I would be here for just went out the window,&quot; says Khall. &quot;I thought I would be in the background, doing my own thing, but I just lost my best friend and now I&#39;m in the minority. I have some thinking to do about what my game plan is, and that&#39;s not my strong suit.&quot;//

Eventually, the town square clears out, and only Buddy and Paula remain.

&quot;Okay, I know Jackie can be kind of difficult,&quot; says Paula, &quot;but I think you went a little harsh on her.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Buddy replies. &quot;It&#39;s honestly none of her business how I play. If she thinks she was entitled to my vote because she supposedly had the better strategy, then she needs a wake-up call.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have to be the one to deliver it,&quot; says Paula. &quot;It pays to let other people do the talking, you know. I know we have to work together, but I might not be able to bail you out if you put yourself in a tricky situation.&quot;

&quot;It shouldn&#39;t have to come to that.&quot; Buddy puts his hands on his hips. &quot;I can handle myself fine, just like I hope that you can. The last thing we want is people getting suspicious of our relationship.&quot;

//&quot;Paula and I have been best friends since the fifth grade,&quot; Buddy admits. &quot;Getting casted on the same season was a total coincidence, but I&#39;m glad it happened because I know she has my back.&quot;//

Paula smiles. &quot;Thanks for coming through on the Tara vote, though.&quot;

&quot;Once you told me you were putting her name down,&quot; Buddy admits, &quot;there wasn&#39;t a doubt in my mind about what I needed to do.  You have a great opportunity here, now make good use of it.&quot;

Before either of them could wrap up the conversation, Rocky emerges from the path leading to the Ochora camp.

&quot;Um... what are you doing here?&quot; Rocky asks.

&quot;Wait, you don&#39;t know?&quot; Buddy replies. &quot;This is the Town Square, where all three tribes can meet. It&#39;s like a communal area, and it&#39;s on the way back from Tribal Council.&quot;

&quot;I did not know that was a thing.&quot; Rocky crosses his arms. &quot;All I know is that Min-Ji went down here yesterday and told us it was a dead end.&quot;

Paula raises an eyebrow. &quot;And she didn&#39;t even bring back the flint?&quot;

&quot;The what now?&quot;

//Rocky stares somewhere behind the camera with an icy glare. &quot;So I gave Saul a hard time for not being able to make fire without flint. Min-Ji tells me we don&#39;t have flint. Now I&#39;m finding out that not only is the flint right here for the taking, but Min-Ji left it here to make me look like a jerk. Well, you know what? I&#39;m not here to be toyed with, and I&#39;ll see to it that she learns why nobody messes with me.&quot;//

&quot;Well, I&#39;ll be back later,&quot; Rocky says bluntly. &quot;I have some smug, dishonest, backstabbing business to take care of.&quot; With that, he turns off and marches back to his camp, even angrier than Jackie was.

Buddy turns back to Paula. &quot;With any luck, the green tribe is going to start crumbling and we won&#39;t have to worry about saving each other.&quot;

$o[**Ochora Tribe**]

Candace is sitting by herself on the ground, in lotus position. She appears to be repeating some affirmations to herself.

&quot;I&#39;ve made up my mind,&quot; she says softly. &quot;Make a move... understand it&#39;s all in your head... it&#39;s your move...&quot;

//&quot;This is a trying time for me,&quot; Candace admits. &quot;I want to be in a new environment for a little while, maybe let it give me a new perspective. I&#39;ve also been continuing my meditation, to keep my mental abilities fine tuned.&quot;//

Candace continues to whisper to herself, not noticing Rocky tiptoeing from behind. &quot;Give up on trying to sell things that they aren&#39;t buying.&quot;

Rocky quickly taps her on the shoulder. Candace winces as if she had just stubbed her toe on the edge of the table, before turning around to face him.

&quot;Rocky,&quot; Candace says with a bit of bitterness, &quot;I was in the middle of something. This better be worth it.&quot;

&quot;It definitely is,&quot; Rocky replies. &quot;I found something BIG, and I need a witness before anything happens.&quot;

Candace gets up. &quot;This better not be a prank.&quot;

&quot;Why would I want to do that?&quot; Rocky asks innocently.

&quot;It just seems like something you&#39;d do,&quot; Candace responds.

&quot;How?! You&#39;ve only known me for four days!&quot; Rocky snaps.

//&quot;I&#39;m confused as to why I suddenly have a terrible reputation,&quot; Rocky admits. &quot;Somebody is trying to set me up. I have a feeling it&#39;s Min-Ji or Jarrett, and I wouldn&#39;t mind getting back at them &#39;cause they turned out to be bores.&quot;//

Min-Ji, meanwhile, had called a tribe meeting with Jarrett, Ashleia, and Saul.

&quot;So, I have just a quick question for you all,&quot; Min-Ji says. &quot;I think that we should be talking about who we end up voting out. Mainly because I&#39;m not sure if we can make it to the swap without losing.&quot;

Saul nods. &quot;I... do not sense that happening. Which is why I think it would be best for us if we vote out Rocky first.&quot;

&quot;Definitely,&quot; Jarrett replies. &quot;Rocky&#39;s a dick. We all know this. And he&#39;s really not that much stronger than Candace, so it&#39;s no question.&quot;

&quot;Inattentiveness is better to deal with than hostility,&quot; Min-Ji adds.

//&quot;I can&#39;t get a good read on Candace,&quot; Min-Ji says flatly. &quot;She&#39;s juggling maybe three different personalities. But the truth of the matter is, at least none of those personalities are toxic, so that&#39;s why she&#39;s safe for now.&quot;//

&quot;Should we talk to Candace about this?&quot; Saul asks. &quot;She might feel hurt if we left her out of the discussion.&quot;

Jarrett narrows his eyes. &quot;I don&#39;t see why that&#39;s important. We have four, that&#39;s all that matters. If she doesn&#39;t vote Rocky, she&#39;s next anyways.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve seen her with Rocky a lot recently,&quot; Min-Ji says. &quot;As far as we should be concerned, they&#39;re basically aligned. Once Rocky&#39;s out it might be a different story.&quot;

&quot;Someone has to keep him occupied so he does not have time to look for an idol,&quot; says Saul.

//&quot;I am pleased that we can come to a consensus,&quot; Saul says with a hint of anxiety. &quot;Although I can only help but to feel uncertain about how to deal with Candace. I do not agree with Jarrett&#39;s ideas of her in the slightest. She is no villain.&quot;//

After the meeting, Min-Ji and Saul stay together to discuss their plans.

&quot;I think the four of us are a solid group,&quot; Min-Ji tells him. &quot;We should be able to all make the swap, and if we can do that then we can rely on each other. As long as we can get rid of Rocky, we can&#39;t have them intimidated by having six Ochora hanging around.&quot;

&quot;Does this mean Candace would be the boot if we lose twice?&quot; Saul asks. &quot;I do not recommend we should be so quick to discard her.&quot;

&quot;Oh good, we&#39;re on the same page after all,&quot; says Min-Ji. She smiles. &quot;Yeah, I didn&#39;t intend on us four staying together. I think what we should do is get Candace on OUR side and vote out Ashleia. She&#39;s an extra vote for Jarrett, and if we save Candace she&#39;ll be more loyal to us than to him.&quot;

&quot;Okay,&quot; says Saul. &quot;You sound like you know what you are talking about. I urge you not to jump the gun, though. Rocky first, then Ashleia.&quot;

//&quot;Everyone has to go at some point,&quot; Min-Ji says with a smirk. &quot;The Rocky vote will lull the others into a false sense of security, and then we can force the others&#39; hands by voting out Ash. Then Jarrett and Candace will HAVE to side with us.&quot;//

Jarrett is holding his own meeting with Ashleia in the shelter.

&quot;Um, Jarrett?&quot; Ashleia asks. &quot;Are we, like, really going to vote out Candace if we lose twice?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not totally sure on that,&quot; Jarrett admits. &quot;To be perfectly honest, all three of them are expendable. It&#39;s just a matter of who we can hold on to for longer. Are Min-Ji and Saul worth voting Candace out over?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; says Ashleia.

&quot;We can figure it out,&quot; Jarrett continues, &quot;IF we get to that point. I&#39;d like it if we can just get rid of Rocky and have the five of us dominate the other tribes.&quot;

//&quot;I&#39;m really not comfortable with leaving this up to chance,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;Like, anyone would tell you that I don&#39;t go to Vegas to win. I mean, what if we lose twice, and then they vote me out because I&#39;m not very strong and they want a stronger group?&quot;//

&quot;Ugh, it would be so much better if the other tribes, like, could talk to us.&quot; Ashleia shakes her head. &quot;We don&#39;t want to, like, just trust that Candace won&#39;t flip. And maybe someone else will want to flip, so if we could just, like, make sure it&#39;s to us.&quot;

&quot;We can only think about what we can do on this tribe,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;Wishful thinking won&#39;t get us anywhere.&quot;

&quot;But are we doing the right thing?&quot; Ashleia asks.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about that,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;Let me do the talking, you worry about making sure the others aren&#39;t trying anything behind our backs.&quot;

//&quot;Ashleia, she&#39;s... trying real hard.&quot; Jarrett shrugs. &quot;Which is more than I can say for some people here. We hold the power here, so if the others can just continue to not see the bigger picture then making merge should be smooth sailing. And from there... we&#39;ll have to see what I can do at the swap.&quot;//

$c[**Chalpe**]

&quot;Look who found the flint!&quot;

The light pink tribe turns their heads to see Buddy triumphantly returning to the campsite. He is holding flint in one hand. &quot;It was on the way back from tribal council. I&#39;ll explain later, for now we need to get started on a fire.&quot;

&quot;Great news!&quot; Lisa cheers. &quot;We mustn&#39;t dilly-dally in making a place for the fire to go!&quot;

Jennifer picks up the machete and walks it over to Buddy. &quot;Think you can get a flame going?&quot;

&quot;Oh, definitely.&quot; Buddy takes the machete and waits for Lisa, Denine, and Rhett to bring over a few dried twigs and other kindling.

//&quot;Whoop dee doo, flint,&quot; says Louie. &quot;Not a big deal for me, since I have natural insulation. Maybe now at least they won&#39;t have the temptation to sleep on top of me.&quot; He rolls his eyes. &quot;Yes, they are still doing it.&quot;//

Buddy tries his hardest to get a fire started by striking the machete against the flint, harshly and deliberately. To his irritation, nothing was catching.

&quot;You&#39;re striking the flint, not chopping it up,&quot; says Denine.

&quot;I see sparks,&quot; Buddy replies, &quot;I got this.&quot;

A minute later, Denine speaks up again. &quot;You&#39;re still not making any progress.&quot;

Buddy annoyedly puts down the flint and machete, and stands up. &quot;Look, Denine, if you know so much about how to start a fire with a knife and flint, why don&#39;t you do it?&quot;

&quot;I will, just watch,&quot; says Denine. She takes the tools for herself and gets to work.

//&quot;Some things aren&#39;t cut and dry,&quot; Buddy explains, &quot;when nature has a thousand different variables to make your life more difficult. Denine apparently didn&#39;t realize that, and I can&#39;t stand having overly critical people like her breathing down my neck and putting even more pressure on me.&quot;//

Denine attempts to get a spark by going slowly and methodically, ensuring she gets the right angle every time. After a few minutes, Buddy gets annoyed.

&quot;Look, you&#39;re just doing the same thing I was,&quot; he says, &quot;only slower. You haven&#39;t even got any sparks to show for it either.&quot;

&quot;This takes time,&quot; Denine snaps.

&quot;What, are you waiting for a sign from the heavens?&quot; Buddy snaps back. &quot;We&#39;re moving BACKWARDS in terms of progress!&quot;

&quot;I know what I&#39;m doing! At least when I do get a spark, it will actually ignite!&quot;

Jennifer gets up and walks over to the fire pit. &quot;Alright, both of you, shut up. You&#39;re wasting energy arguing that you could use, oh I don&#39;t know, actually helping us.&quot;

&quot;Tell Buddy to get off my back,&quot; Denine tells her.

&quot;Me, getting off YOUR back? You dragged us into this!&quot; Buddy argues.

//&quot;The honeymoon was short, our tribe is falling apart,&quot; says Rhett with a sigh. &quot;Was this group hand picked to fail? I feel like anything could have set those two off, and it might not get better.&quot;//

Lisa pulls Louie aside to talk to him alone.

&quot;I am ashamed that some of our tribemates have fallen to this level of animosity,&quot; she says with a tinge of disappointment. &quot;I believe we should discuss if we should vote out one of the two squabblers.&quot;

&quot;I already wanted to vote out Buddy,&quot; says Louie. &quot;He&#39;s a glory-seeking little brat.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t appreciate your word choice,&quot; Lisa replies. &quot;We should not stoop to their level. Regardless, what are your considerations with regards to voting Denine?&quot;

Denine, who was standing nearby, calls out &quot;Don&#39;t even! Take that thought right out of your head.&quot;

&quot;Oh, Denine! I apologize profusely!&quot; says Lisa. &quot;It was merely a hypothetical! I have no qualms with voting Buddy.&quot;

//&quot;I quite nearly got myself in a predicament there,&quot; Lisa explains. &quot;Denine was quite tense, and I did not intend her to witness me suggesting she be eliminated. Fortunately for her, this is not with a tribal council incoming.&quot;//

Lisa leaves to discuss a similar prospect with Rhett and Jennifer, while Denine sits down with Louie.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind voting either out, actually,&quot; says Denine. &quot;Lisa... ugh there&#39;s just something about her. She&#39;s so cutesy it&#39;s irritating.&quot;

Louie nods. &quot;It&#39;s a sort of sugary innocence that I suppose is supposed to be endearing?&quot;

&quot;Endearing, more like punchable,&quot; Denine replies.

&quot;Is she really worse than Buddy?&quot; Louie asks.

Denine stops to think for a moment.

//&quot;I&#39;m beginning to wonder if we&#39;re spoiled for choice when it comes to who we should vote out,&quot; Denine admits, &quot;or I&#39;m just growing to dislike everyone, one person at a time. Either way I won&#39;t feel guilt when it comes time to start mowing people down.&quot;//

$q[**Quibas**]

&quot;Monty, you have a minute?&quot;

Monty turns his head to see Jackie walking up to him.

&quot;Sure, I guess,&quot; Monty replies.

&quot;I want to apologize for going against you,&quot; Jackie explains. &quot;I kind of went, like, haywire. We should maybe work together instead of fighting.&quot;

Monty takes a deep breath before responding. &quot;Why should I go with you?&quot;

&quot;Paula and Vaclav are both young and fit,&quot; Jackie explains. &quot;They&#39;re going to gravitate towards each other, and it only makes sense that if something goes south, they&#39;re going to try to cut you loose first. If you go with them, you&#39;re at the bottom. Side with me, and Khall is nothing to be worried about.&quot;

//&quot;Well, I guess it&#39;s a good thing that Jackie wants ta bury the hatchet,&quot; says Monty. &quot;She got some smarts to her after all. But I&#39;m not going to trust her completely.&quot;//

&quot;One down, two to go,&quot; Jackie says to Khall.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asks her purple-clad ally.

&quot;Seeing as that the two of us are together, and the other three only came together to get Tara out,&quot; Jackie explains, &quot;then it&#39;s worth trying to get them all to turn on each other. They can&#39;t trust each other, because if they do then they&#39;ll take it easy and we might lose again.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s something wrong with your logic,&quot; Khall replies, &quot;but I&#39;m not exactly sure what it is.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s because it&#39;s flawless,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;I&#39;ve thought about this, and it&#39;s what we have to do.&quot;

//&quot;Khall is a dimwit, but at least he&#39;s a useful one,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;With him, I have two votes for the price of one since I&#39;m the one making all the decisions.&quot;//

Paula crosses her arms while listening to Jackie tell her about the importance of having a truce.

&quot;Don&#39;t you remember how close we used to be?&quot; Jackie adds to her increasingly lengthy monologue. &quot;I thought we had something, and I want to know if we can get that magic back.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, sorry, I voted her out already,&quot; Paula replies bluntly.

&quot;No, I don&#39;t mean Tara!&quot; Jackie protests. &quot;I mean us being a duo. We could go back to the plan we had!&quot;

Paula hums while looking upwards. &quot;I... maybe. I&#39;ll have to think about it.&quot;

 &quot;This again? You know, I can just tell the boys that I&#39;m up to side with them after all,&quot; says Jackie.

//&quot;My mom once told me that some people think like sports cars, quick and flashy,&quot; Paula explains. &quot;Other people are like pickup trucks, steady and reliable. I&#39;m the pickup truck, finding the path that&#39;s right for me, while Jackie is the sports car that&#39;s out of control and about to be wrapped around a tree somewhere.&quot;//

Jackie concludes her efforts by talking to Vaclav, this time bringing Khall with her.

&quot;Paula and Monty have a strong bond, you know,&quot; Jackie explains. &quot;Paula&#39;s the one who jumped to Monty&#39;s defense before you did. Aren&#39;t you concerned that they might be, I don&#39;t know, using you?&quot;

&quot;Maybe a little,&quot; Vaclav admits. &quot;But why would you be better? You two are solid! I&#39;ll just be third to you guys!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re already third to them,&quot; Jackie counters. &quot;They just wanted to make sure that Monty didn&#39;t leave. And now he&#39;s still here and they can kidnap someone to give them the numbers, so they don&#39;t need you anymore.&quot;

&quot;Isn&#39;t that what you want to do as well?&quot; Vaclav crosses his arms and tries to look stern, but still comes across as jittery.

Khall turns his head to Jackie. &quot;Yeah, I thought that was your plan.&quot;

&quot;NO IT&#39;S NOT,&quot; Jackie says abruptly. She turns to Vaclav. &quot;Don&#39;t listen to him! You&#39;re overestimating how much they care about you. They just wanted an excuse to vote off Tara, and you gave them the perfect one. And now how do they know you won&#39;t go crazy on one of them? What makes you think they&#39;ll take that risk?&quot;

//&quot;Jackie makes some good points, as much as I don&#39;t want to believe it,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;How do I know that Monty and Paula aren&#39;t just going to use me and then toss me aside? But why wouldn&#39;t Jackie and Khall do the same thing? Paula might have helped me get Tara out before she could hurt me, but I know they don&#39;t believe how serious that was! Do they see me as a joke?&quot; He buries his face in his hands.//

$t[**Town Square**]

&quot;So this is it?&quot; Candace asks. &quot;Rocky, what&#39;s the point of it?&quot;

&quot;Remember yesterday, when Min-Ji went down this same path and said it was a dead end?&quot; Rocky replies.

Candace nods. &quot;Wait... that was a straight path, there weren&#39;t any branches she could have taken.&quot;

&quot;Then she clearly lied to us,&quot; says Rocky.

//&quot;I gotta make sure Candace has all the facts, the real ones, from ME, before she takes someone else&#39;s side,&quot; Rocky explains. &quot;They&#39;re scheming something good back there, and I&#39;m not going to sit pretty and let them walk over me. So as Candace as my witness, I will smash anyone who doubts me into the dirt.&quot;//

&quot;I guess you weren&#39;t making this up as some sort of distraction,&quot; Candace admits. &quot;This is called the Town Square?&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; says Rocky, &quot;but don&#39;t tell anyone else.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not really a square,&quot; says Candace. &quot;Not that I want it to be one. Squares are so... artificial, and they can scar the earth in their bluntness, you know?&quot;

&quot;I really don&#39;t,&quot; Rocky replies.

&quot;Hey, they have a little podium for each tribe, let&#39;s see what the green one says.&quot; Candace walks over to the Ochora podium, only to find her tribe&#39;s flint.

&quot;What the hell? Why is it all the way over here?&quot; she asks.

Rocky shrugs. &quot;It was here when I got there, and the other tribes said it was like that for them too.&quot;

Candace considers whether this might be a bluff, but ultimately decides she has no reason to think so. &quot;Then if Min-Ji was here like you said, why didn&#39;t she take it?&quot;

&quot;Because she didn&#39;t want us to be talking to other tribes,&quot; says Rocky. He crosses his arms and smirks. &quot;That way, she doesn&#39;t have to worry about anyone saying voting me out first isn&#39;t the best idea.&quot;

&quot;Your justification is dead wrong,&quot; says Candace. &quot;But I guess if she wants to be the leader, then she wants to make sure she can oversee everything?&quot;

&quot;Whatever it is,&quot; Rocky replies, &quot;she&#39;s sabotaging the tribe. Whether she intends to or not.&quot;

//&quot;I have noticed that Rocky has a sickly aura,&quot; says Candace. &quot;It is one that seeks only to destroy and inflict grief. He is no fool, though, and if ridding our tribe of him is not guaranteed, it helps to know that I&#39;m his confidant, the one who will not be in harm&#39;s way if this... darkness manifests.&quot;//

$o[**Ochora**]

Candace is by herself, sitting on a treestump, meditating again. This time she is interrupted by Min-Ji.

&quot;Hey, is everything alright with you?&quot; Min-Ji asks. &quot;It&#39;s been a while since we&#39;ve seen you not be with Rocky.&quot;

&quot;I guess I&#39;ve been stuck keeping an eye on him, so he doesn&#39;t cause any funny business,&quot; Candace explains. &quot;Just as pollution will poison the earth when released, so too will he poison this tribe&#39;s feng shui.&quot;

Min-Ji scratches her head, trying to figure out what Candace means. &quot;Well, I guess the more important question is what&#39;s Rocky up to?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t say I was his babysitter,&quot; Candace replies dryly.

//&quot;Okay, seriously?&quot; Candace crosses her arms. &quot;What is with this tribe and blocking every attempt I make to reconnect with Mother Gaia? I need some kind of release once in a while!&quot;//

&quot;But what if he finds an idol?&quot; Min-Ji asks.

&quot;If you&#39;re so worried about it, maybe you should pitch in and help me out,&quot; Candace snaps. &quot;That goes for all four of you, by the way.&quot;

&quot;We all have our roles here,&quot; says Min-Ji. &quot;Sorry that yours isn&#39;t the most glamorous, but it has to be done.&quot;

&quot;So, what&#39;s your role?&quot; comes a voice from behind them.

Min-Ji and Candace turn around and see Rocky, glaring directly at Min-Ji.

&quot;Hiding the flint from the whole tribe so we all STARVE?&quot; Rocky growls. &quot;What a role!  You&#39;re so helpful, Min-Ji!&quot;

&quot;This isn&#39;t about you, Rocky,&quot; Min-Ji snaps.

&quot;Okay, one, you&#39;re full of shit,&quot; Rocky nearly yells. &quot;Two, I&#39;m making it about you now. You think you can get away with just hiding the season&#39;s big twist from everyone?

&quot;I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about!&quot; says Min-Ji, her tone getting angrier as well. &quot;Candace, what the hell did you tell him!?&quot;

&quot;Excuse me, what do you mean what did I tell him?&quot; Candace yells. &quot;He&#39;s a major tool, sure, but I&#39;m not the one who fed him lies!&quot;

//&quot;This is why I needed a stable four and not three,&quot; says Min-Ji. &quot;You get stuff like this happening. I figured that maybe Candace wouldn&#39;t be dumb enough to completely fall into Rocky&#39;s hands, but heeeere we go! Might need to go after her and not Ashleia if she&#39;s going to stick with this nonsense!&quot;//

Jarrett, Saul, and Ashleia then arrive, having ran as fast as they could.

&quot;We heard yelling,&quot; says Saul. &quot;What is happening over here, should we be concerned?&quot;

Min-Ji starts to explain herself, but Rocky merely holds out the flint for them all to see.

&quot;What the... where did you get that?&quot; Jarrett asks, stunned. &quot;And why did you hide that from us?&quot;

&quot;Min-Ji was the one who hid this!&quot; Rocky explains. &quot;There&#39;s this big space down the path where she said was a dead end, and that&#39;s where I found a flint for each tribe! The other tribes at least weren&#39;t dumb enough to leave theirs behind!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re bluffing!&quot; Min-Ji snaps. &quot;This is some last-ditch effort to save yourself from the inevitable conclusion that you&#39;re out next because you&#39;re a douchecanoe!&quot;

The rest of the tribe (minus Candace) nods.

&quot;Well screw you guys!&quot; Rocky growls. &quot;Sorry that I&#39;m not going to bend over for you all! I&#39;m here to win, and ALL of you should know better than to not mess with me! Especially you, Min-Ji, how dare you tarnish my name to make yourself look good-&quot;

&quot;It was already tarnished,&quot; say Min-Ji and Jarrett at the same time.

&quot;Shut up!&quot; Rocky snaps. &quot;Min-Ji, you&#39;re the one who&#39;s been making us all starve for your own little strategy! You could have just gotten the flint from there but noooo!&quot;

Min-Ji turns to Candace. &quot;Why did you let this happen? What&#39;s this Town Square bull about?&quot;

Candace&#39;s eyes lit up. &quot;So you ARE full of it! How did you know what it was called?&quot;

&quot;I never called it by name!&quot; Rocky adds.

&quot;Hey, no fair! You could have said that no matter what!&quot; Min-Ji calls back.

&quot;All&#39;s fair in love and war, sweetheart,&quot; says Rocky.

//&quot;Here we see the sneaky Min-Ji backed into a corner,&quot; says Rocky, with a fake Australian accent. &quot;Crikey, there&#39;s no escape from the ferocious Rocky armed with the TRUTH! It should be obvious, but this will definitely be the first of many that I take down!&quot;//

&quot;If you want proof, why don&#39;t you just walk down the path that Min-Ji insisted was a dead end?&quot; says Candace.

&quot;You can&#39;t vote me out just because I might have gotten lost!&quot; Min-Ji snaps. &quot;Isn&#39;t it more likely that Rocky&#39;s just been hiding the flint the entire time?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s really not, but nice try, thanks for playing.&quot; Rocky smirks.

&quot;Rocky, we still have five votes to get rid of you,&quot; says Saul. &quot;Even if you kidnap your biggest fan, you will have to admit defeat.&quot;

&quot;Never!&quot;

//&quot;I had another vision,&quot; says Saul. &quot;I felt anguish and tension, and saw a house of cards collapsing. This might mean Ochora is going to collapse... but please let that be after we vote Rocky out. There&#39;s always a swap to look forward to, and if that is when it happens then I will be okay.&quot;//

A little later, Min-Ji, Saul, and Jarrett broke away from the argument after it devolved into Rocky replying to everything with &quot;No, you!&quot;

&quot;See, this is why I&#39;m glad the four of us are together,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;Rocky is nothing but trouble, and Candace is just enabling him now.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, let&#39;s just take them out,&quot; says Min-Ji. &quot;Do you think we should try to split the vote since Candace clearly hasn&#39;t actually been watching Rocky?&quot;

Jarrett shakes his head. &quot;That would be opening us up to the kidnapped person siding with them. We need to be solid. But should we really target Rocky, or try to flush an idol by voting Candace?&quot;

&quot;I do not believe he has an idol,&quot; says Saul.

&quot;Better safe than sorry.&quot;

//&quot;If Rocky is going to be this difficult for Min-Ji to deal with, then the enemy of my enemy is my friend,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;If we could get Candace out when we lose, then use Rocky to toss Min-Ji and Saul, that would be glorious.&quot;//

&quot;We should ask Ashleia what she thinks, first,&quot; says Saul.

&quot;Wait, where is she?&quot; Jarrett asks. &quot;Wasn&#39;t she there when Rocky was having a tantrum?&quot;

&quot;I thought she was with you!&quot; Min-Ji&#39;s eyes widen.

//&quot;At least I&#39;m not the only one who just assumed she was there,&quot; Min-Ji says. &quot;It&#39;s not a good look, though. Although as long as she doesn&#39;t see it, she won&#39;t really put two and two together.&quot;//

$c[**Chalpe**]

Jennifer and Rhett are standing in a creek they found some distance away from camp, trying to catch fish by closing in on them and snatching them out of the water.

&quot;This doesn&#39;t seem to be working,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;We HAVE fishing gear, you know, there&#39;s no reason we should be getting our pants wet.&quot;

&quot;I tried to use the gear for five hours yesterday, and I didn&#39;t get a single bite,&quot; Rhett replies. &quot;Do you have any better ideas?&quot;

&quot;Maybe a little bit more patience?&quot; Jennifer suggests.

&quot;My stomach disagrees.&quot;

//&quot;Rhett is really down to earth in a way nobody else on this tribe is,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;All four of the others have good reasons to be voted off, I think. I can&#39;t say the same for Rhett, so whatever I decide on doing, I&#39;d like him to be in the know.&quot;//

After another unsuccessful grab, Rhett looks up to face Jennifer, but she begins to speak first.

&quot;Hey, Rhett, I&#39;m thinking I might volunteer to be the tribe leader,&quot; she explains.

&quot;What have you been doing for the past five days?&quot; Rhett jokes.

Jennifer chuckles. &quot;I guess you&#39;re right. But I want you to be my partner in crime, because I trust you to be sane and collected while everyone else continues to fight amongst each other.&quot;

Rhett nods. &quot;I don&#39;t see why not. Never hurts to have a stable partnership. I can trust you, can&#39;t I?&quot;

&quot;You can,&quot; says Jennifer.

//&quot;I have my doubts about this,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;Jennifer may be a good ally to have, but she&#39;s already come off fairly strong. I know Buddy has told me how she&#39;s already starting to annoy him. If Jennifer isn&#39;t getting respect as a tribe leader, should I really be advocating for her to lead?&quot;//

&quot;Well, who should we vote if we lose?&quot; Rhett asks. &quot;Surely you have some kind of plan.&quot;

&quot;I think it would have to be Louie,&quot; Jennifer explains. &quot;Sure, he&#39;s a strong swimmer, but on land he&#39;s pretty weak. The first challenge was water-based, future ones he might be slowing us down.&quot;

&quot;If you&#39;re talking about strength,&quot; Rhett replies, &quot;I think Lisa might be the better bet. She&#39;s admitted she isn&#39;t much of a swimmer, and she&#39;s not that much better than Louie otherwise.&quot;

Jennifer looks to the side. &quot;Yeah, I guess, but Lisa&#39;s done nothing to make us angry at her... like all three of the others have.&quot;

&quot;Speaking of which, is Buddy really as bad as Denine and Louie claim he is?&quot; Rhett asks. &quot;Sure, he&#39;s a downer, and he has a knack for looking down on people. The thing is, those two are starting to swing the same way.&quot;

&quot;As long as they&#39;re not in cahoots,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;But if we don&#39;t vote Louie, we can&#39;t really go after Denine either, since they&#39;re already a pair.&quot;

&quot;But if we vote Louie,&quot; says Rhett, &quot;then Denine will be furious and-&quot; He stops mid-sentence, and points at a fish swimming at around his ankles.

Both Rhett and Jennifer rush to reach down and try to grab it, only to bash their heads together.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I got it!&quot;

Rhett rubs his head and stands up, only to see the fish was caught not by Jennifer, but by Khall.

&quot;Wait, aren&#39;t you on Quibas?&quot; Rhett asks.

&quot;He is,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

Khall stays silent for a few seconds. &quot;Well... can I keep the fish?&quot;

$q[**Quibas**]

//&quot;Okay, so I don&#39;t know where Khall has been today,&quot; says Jackie, &quot;but truth be told does it look like I care? I have more important things to worry about – making the majority freak out with a fake immunity idol made by yours truly.&quot;//

&quot;Now that I have a shot of turning things around,&quot; Jackie mutters while putting the finishing touches on her fake idol, &quot;maybe I can lull someone into a false sense of security. And then, if they try to split the votes, then we just get the kidnapper to vote with us!&quot;

She smiles as she places her idol in the dirt. &quot;I can just see the pain on their faces when they try to play this...&quot; She then runs to hide behind a bush and see if someone will find it.

Sure enough, she notices Monty arriving back at camp with some firewood. Monty notices the fake idol, barely hidden at all, and picks it up.

//&quot;I know Jackie wanted me out last time,&quot; says Monty, &quot;so an idol might be just what I need to make sure she doesn&#39;t do it again.&quot; He spits on the ground. &quot;Real shame that all I found was a rock tied to a stick.&quot;//

Monty sees Jackie hiding in the bush and walks over to her. &quot;Hey, Jackie, I found an idol! You want it?&quot;

Jackie curses under her breath, before getting up. &quot;Monty, you touched it first, so it&#39;s yours, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;I think you need to trust us more,&quot; says Monty. &quot;Consider this a token of good will, since we&#39;re working together now, right?&quot;

As the two continue to offer each other the fake, Vaclav arrives and picks it up where Monty was sitting.

&quot;Is this the idol they&#39;re talking about?&quot; Vaclav wonders aloud. &quot;It doesn&#39;t totally look like one, but those two aren&#39;t stupid.&quot; His brow furrows. &quot;Is this a setup? Is there some twist attached to it that could hurt my game? What if Khall saw me pick this up!? Oh god. I can&#39;t use this. I need to deal with this. Fire. Into the fire!&quot;

Vaclav hurls the fake idol into the fire, to the horror of Jackie and Monty, who turn around in time to see it.

&quot;MY FAKE IDOL!&quot; Jackie and Monty both cry out at the same time.

Vaclav looks back over to his tribemates. &quot;Wait, are you two serious?&quot;

//&quot;I&#39;m just as lost as I was when I thought it could be a real idol,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;Did that make sense to anyone else?&quot;//

$t[**Town Square**]

Paula paces around in front of the torches. &quot;Where could he be? I thought we agreed on this time of day.&quot;

She stops to reflect on whether she worded things correctly when someone taps her shoulder. She turns around to be face to hood with Khall.

&quot;Heya, Paula!&quot; he says cheerfully. &quot;Looking for someone?&quot;

Paula shrugs. &quot;Wondering if they&#39;re going to show, as well.&quot;

&quot;So I guess it&#39;s someone on another tribe,&quot; says Khall. &quot;Oh, that blond boy on the pink tribe that voted with us!&quot;

&quot;Why would it be him?&quot; Paula asks, nervously fidgeting behind her back. &quot;We shouldn&#39;t be putting all our eggs in one basket.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not a very good liar,&quot; Khall says flatly.

&quot;I&#39;m not-&quot;

Khall extends a gloved finger to her lips. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I think I know.&quot; Paula&#39;s eyes go wide in horror.

&quot;Paula has a boooyfrieeeeend!&quot; teases Khall, waggling his eyebrows.

//&quot;I think my heart skipped a beat,&quot; says Paula, &quot;if not a whole measure. I thought I was done before I had even started. But luckily, Khall seems to be innocent and harmless. Unless he knows the truth and is willing to spill, right now I would rather keep him over Jackie.&quot;//

The two hear a sudden shout from the direction of their camp.

&quot;What was that!? Should we go check it out?&quot; Paula asks, her face slightly pale.

Khall shakes his head. &quot;I don&#39;t think we should. It&#39;s best that they work it out themselves, and if it was really important the whole tribe would be there.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think it works like that,&quot; says Paula.

&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; Khall replies. &quot;I forgot that sometimes one person is left out of the loop for comedic purposes.&quot;

&quot;No!&quot;

//&quot;I&#39;m trying to be friendly with Paula, since I think she&#39;s the thinker of her group,&quot; says Khall. &quot;So if we can&#39;t get someone to flip, then hopefully Paula can say that I&#39;m worth keeping over Jackie. I didn&#39;t want to think about turning on someone so soon, but desperate times call for desperate measures.&quot;//

&quot;What are you two so worked up about?&quot;

The pair turns to see someone approaching from a different camp.

&quot;Oh, hi,&quot; says Paula. &quot;I don&#39;t believe we&#39;ve met. What&#39;s your name?&quot;

&quot;My name&#39;s Ashleia Berns!&quot; Ashleia says cheerfully. &quot;I&#39;m on the Ochora tribe. It rhymes with Laura!&quot;

&quot;I know how to say your tribe&#39;s name,&quot; says Paula, raising an eyebrow.

&quot;Well, at the start I used to forget,&quot; Ashleia replies. &quot;That helped me remember.&quot;

&quot;Geez, don&#39;t be so insensitive, Paula.&quot; Khall pokes Paula in the arm.

Ashleia looks around. &quot;So... what is this place, anyways? I&#39;m not at your camp, right?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve never been to the Town Square before?&quot; Paula asks.

Ashleia stops to think for a moment. &quot;No, but, like, we thought someone on our tribe was lying about it. So, I snuck out to take a look for myself! And I guess it&#39;s real.&quot;

&quot;But you already got the flint,&quot; says Khall. &quot;You sure you thought it was made up?&quot;

&quot;Oh... OH! He&#39;s right about everything then!&quot; Ashleia claps politely for herself a couple times. &quot;Everything&#39;s coming together! I have to go tell Jarrett!&quot;

Immunity Challenge**

Vincent welcomes each tribe to the challenge beach, before showing them a replica of a //quipu//, or a recording device consisting of spun and knotted threads attached to a single string or wooden bar.
He describes the next challenge as dealing with the devices, but instead of using the quipu as a counting device, one person on each tribe will be using them as a key to a block puzzle.
Each tribe has a wall consisting of twenty blocks sticking out of it that can be pushed and pulled into it.
Each block needs to be pushed or pulled a certain amount to open up a space inside the wall that a ball can roll through.
The first tribe to roll a ball behind every block in a single run wins immunity and comfort in the form of blankets. The second tribe to do so only wins immunity, and the third tribe goes to tribal council.

Quipu Readers: $c[Rhett], $o[Ashleia], $q[Paula]
Puzzle Solvers:
$c[Buddy, Jennifer, Lisa, Louie]
$o[Candace, Jarrett, Min-Ji, Rocky]
$q[Jackie, Khall, Monty, Vaclav]
Sit-outs: $c[Denine], $o[Saul]

At the last second, the quipu readers are given a cruel twist - their quipu each have 24 strings, each of the puzzle solvers is given a number that matches the number of a string that should be ignored, and they cannot use words to tell the reader which strings are to be ignored.

Paula decides to go one block at a time, realizing there are about five relative positions for a knot on each string.
Rhett assigns five blocks to each puzzle solver
Ashleia first tries to get everyone to tell them what number they have through charades

The challenge proves to be slow, but Paula&#39;s one-at-a-time approach lets Quibas make progress faster
Rhett starts out with Louie and the first five blocks. When Louie finishes his section, Ashleia is still playing charades to find the dummy strings, and Paula is already at string 11

When Ashleia has determined all four numbers, she lays her quipu on the ground and hides the four dummy strings. She then copies Paula&#39;s strategy of going string by string.
As Rhett and Buddy finish the second section, Paula is at string 19 and Ashleia is already at string 5

Rhett and Jennifer get to work on the third section, but while they do that Ashleia reaches her tenth string and Paula finishes with the last string.
Paula gestures to Khall to try rolling the ball through, but Khall trips over the ball instead. Vaclav picks it up and trips over Khall.

Rhett and Ashleia reach their 15th string at the same time, while Jackie places the ball at its starting position and lets it go through.
The ball successfully rolls through the tunnel on the first go, meaning $q[Quibas wins immunity and blankets!]

Ashleia proves to be slightly faster at interpreting the quipu than Rhett, and finishes up while Rhett is on his 22nd string. She gets Min-Ji to try to roll the ball through...

...it bounces out the back end of the puzzle about halfway through. Ashleia races to the quipu to try and figure out which one she messed up.

Chalpe is delighted by the opportunity to steal the win, but discover that Rhett also made a mistake.

A few minutes of frantic double-checking later, and one tribe manages to correct their mistakes and roll their ball through first.

$c[Chalpe wins immunity!]
$o[Ochora loses, and will have to vote out someone at tribal council]

Ochora is instructed to pick someone from the Quibas tribe to join them, but before anyone can debate, Rocky picks Paula.
Paula tells her tribe &quot;I&#39;ll be fine, see you tonight.&quot; and heads off with Ochora.

$o[**Ochora**]

The green tribe and Paula gather in the shelter.

&quot;Well, that could have gone better,&quot; says Jarrett.

&quot;I don&#39;t know how it was so hard for the rest of you,&quot; Paula chimes in.

&quot;We don&#39;t need to hear how much better you are than us,&quot; Min-Ji interrupts. &quot;Just let us resolve something. Where did your tribe get flint?&quot;

Paula briefly considers telling the truth, but decides against it. She shrugs. &quot;I didn&#39;t find it, I&#39;m not the one you should be asking.&quot;

&quot;You found it at the Town Square, right?&quot; Candace asks.

&quot;Candace, it&#39;s obvious you&#39;re trying to cover for Rocky,&quot; says Min-Ji. &quot;Even Paula doesn&#39;t know-&quot;

&quot;Screw you, Min-Ji!&quot; Candace snaps. &quot;Screw you! You&#39;re a crap liar, a crap leader, and you&#39;re a crap...&quot; She pauses. &quot;You&#39;re a bitch!&quot; With that, Candace stands up and storms off.

&quot;Boy, you sure settled that argument,&quot; says Rocky.

//&quot;I try to keep a cool head,&quot; Candace explains, &quot;but there&#39;s only so much hostility and dishonesty that I can take. And as obnoxious as Rocky is, I&#39;m getting scared of Min-Ji showing her true colours. One of them has to leave tonight.&quot;//

&quot;Rocky,&quot; Saul says gently, &quot;it is no longer about the missing flint. We are concerned about your attitude.&quot;

&quot;Pssh, my attitude&#39;s fine!&quot; Rocky protests. &quot;I just don&#39;t work with fakes and liars.&quot;

&quot;Everyone lies in Survivor, dumbass,&quot; says Jarrett.

&quot;This is exactly what we&#39;re talking about,&quot; says Min-Ji.

&quot;Because if we were talking about the flint still, you&#39;d have to admit you were wrong,&quot; Rocky snaps. &quot;I get it now.&quot;

Saul holds his head. &quot;Guys... I&#39;m getting something...&quot;

&quot;Yeah, a reality check,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;Min-Ji, I&#39;m putting your name down tonight. You have nobody to blame but yourself.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m shaking,&quot; says Min-Ji sarcastically, as Rocky gets up and leaves.

//&quot;I only have one shot to survive tonight,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;Tonight, that&#39;s exposing Min-Ji as someone who&#39;s been destroying us from the inside. If these morons are as gullible as they are with her, they&#39;re dumb enough to turn on her.&quot;//

&quot;Okay, I had envisioned two bales of hay,&quot; Saul explains to the remaining players. &quot;One of which was sliced through with a green knife, and the other had some sort of critter pulled out of it.&quot;

&quot;So basically, one scenario in which you split the vote and one in which you all gang up on Rocky,&quot; says Paula.

&quot;That is indeed what I interpret it as,&quot; says Saul. &quot;But then... there was a fire and one of the hay bales turned to ash.&quot;

&quot;Which one was it?&quot; Ashleia asks.

&quot;I... do not know,&quot; Saul admits. &quot;Rocky was yelling about his vote around that time so I lost focus.&quot;

&quot;Can you just try and focus, see if you can remember?&quot; asks Min-Ji.

&quot;Min-Ji, I am not a DVR,&quot; replies Saul.

//&quot;I would like to believe my vision justifies our plan to vote out Rocky,&quot; Saul explains. &quot;Although now I fear we will never know. Funnily enough, that is another reason to vote him out.&quot;//

&quot;Do you ever get sequels to your visions?&quot; Ashleia asks.

&quot;Hmm... yes. But they always occur when the incident in question has occurred, and I cannot intervene any longer.&quot;

&quot;Oh, so like when movie studios let terrible movies get sequels!&quot; Ashleia nods. &quot;I get it now.&quot;

&quot;...right.&quot; Saul gets up and dusts off his pants. &quot;I am continuing to vote Rocky out tonight, maybe without him I will have the peace to see a whole vision again.&quot; He walks off, and Min-Ji hurries to follow him.

Ashleia, Jarrett, and Paula are left in the shelter.

&quot;Jarrett, what should we do?&quot; Ashleia asks. &quot;Like, I think if we all vote together we get to decide.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine with whatever you guys want,&quot; says Paula. &quot;I&#39;d rather not be responsible, if you know what I mean.&quot;

Jarrett nods. &quot;I know what we should do.&quot;

//&quot;Tonight, I have two choices,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;First, I can side with Min-Ji and eliminate Rocky. That will keep those two happy, at least. But I could use Rocky and draw first blood with Min-Ji, eliminating a rival. The only problem is that Saul will be mad... If he&#39;s capable of anger... but at least then he and Min-Ji don&#39;t have time to think of backstabbing me first. It all comes down to whether Rocky is more useful than the Min-Ji and Saul duo.&quot;//

$v[**Tribal Council**]

The Ochora Tribe, with Paula, walks into the tribal council building. The Ochora members ignite their torches during Vincent&#39;s fire-is-life spiel, while Paula merely places hers behind the seats when she sits down. The members of Ochora then turn to join her.

$v[&quot;Jarrett, give me a rundown of what has happened at your tribe in the past six days.&quot;]

&quot;We got to camp, we didn&#39;t have a fire for a little while,&quot; says Jarrett, &quot;and then Rocky claims he found it and that Min-Ji knew about it but didn&#39;t bring it.&quot;

&quot;Since we got our torches from the Town Square,&quot; Rocky interjects, &quot;it&#39;s not a claim anymore. We know it&#39;s a fact.&quot;

Min-Ji rolls her eyes. &quot;Ooh no, I told one little fib to make sure you didn&#39;t get the idol. A real tragedy for the rest of us.&quot;

&quot;You owe us three days&#39; worth of cooked rice,&quot; Rocky mutters.

$v[&quot;Min-Ji, are you targeting Rocky over this?&quot;]

&quot;I&#39;m targeting Rocky because he&#39;s an obnoxious man-child,&quot; says Min-Ji. &quot;He&#39;s impossible to work with or talk to.&quot;

$v[&quot;Those are some big words, Rocky. How do you respond to that?&quot;]

&quot;By voting against her,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;She nearly sank the tribe, after all.&quot;

&quot;Okay, I didn&#39;t starve you guys!&quot; Min-Ji snaps. &quot;We had plenty of food.&quot;

&quot;However crunchy.&quot; Rocky rolls his eyes. &quot;You know, from being RAW and all.&quot;

$v[&quot;Ashleia, you had the key role in today&#39;s challenge that sent you guys here. Looking at this, do you think you might be in danger regardless?&quot;]

&quot;I, like, hope not,&quot; says Ashleia, twirling a few strands of hair with her finger. &quot;I think it&#39;s too early to be looking at how strong you are at everything.&quot;

&quot;Challenges are always a concern,&quot; says Paula. &quot;It&#39;s what stops you from coming back here.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I know that much,&quot; Ashleia replies. &quot;But, like, how many more keep-a-boo challenges will we have?&quot;

&quot;Ashleia, the word you want is //quipu,//&quot; says Saul.

&quot;That doesn&#39;t make any sense, though.&quot; Ashleia trails off, trying to figure out what word Saul said with a weird accent.

$v[&quot;Candace, should Ashleia be worried? How does the challenge affect tonight&#39;s decision?&quot;]

&quot;Not very much,&quot; Candace admits. &quot;Rocky and Min-Ji have been bickering and fighting for a little while now. We all kind of want to vote one of them out for some peace and quiet.&quot;

&quot;Trust me, if you don&#39;t vote him out the last thing you&#39;ll have is peace and quiet,&quot; says Min-Ji.

&quot;You can&#39;t silence the truth forever,&quot; Rocky snaps. 

&quot;Both of you, shut up before they call in security,&quot; says Jarrett, suddenly very stern.

$v[&quot;Well, okay then. And with that, time to vote. Paula, do you want to give up immunity?&quot;]

&quot;No way, not with this going on.&quot; Paula crosses her arms.

$v[&quot;Then it&#39;s time to vote. Saul, you&#39;re up first.&quot;]

...

Min-Ji reveals her vote to be for **Rocky**. &quot;I&#39;d hate to be there if your delusions come crashing down.&quot;

Rocky reveals his vote to be for **Min-Ji**. &quot;You&#39;re shady, AND you&#39;re a killjoy! That&#39;s what I call a two-for-one.&quot;

...

$v[&quot;Min-Ji. That is one vote for Min-Ji and one vote for Rocky.&quot;]
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$v[&quot;Next vote... Min-Ji.&quot;]

&quot;Thanks, Candace.&quot; Min-Ji glares at her. &quot;You know this just means you&#39;re next.&quot;

&quot;Bring it,&quot; says Candace.

$v[&quot;Rocky. We are tied again with two votes each.&quot;]

&quot;The moment of truth is upon us,&quot; Saul mumbles.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$v[&quot;Min-Ji. She leads with three.&quot;]

Rocky smirks.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$v[&quot;Second $boot is... Min-Ji. You need to bring me your torch.&quot;]

Min-Ji turns around quickly to face Jarrett. &quot;What the hell was that!?&quot;

&quot;What does it look like?&quot; Jarrett smirks. &quot;Pre-emptive strike.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s pre-emptive strikes,&quot; says Min-Ji, getting up, &quot;and there&#39;s being a moron.&quot; She takes her torch and walks it to in front of Vincent.

$v[&quot;Min-Ji, the tribe has spoken.&quot;] Vincent extinguishes the young Korean woman&#39;s torch. $v[&quot;Time for you to go.&quot;]

&quot;I look forward to seeing you join me,&quot; says Min-Ji.

&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; says Rocky.

$v[&quot;Tonight, it appears you chose the enemy you knew over the enemy you did not,&quot;] says Vincent. $v[&quot;Was Min-Ji right about this being premature, or will this prove to be the right move after all? You can head back to camp.&quot;]
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$o[//&quot;What is that tribe smoking? Why on Earth would they keep Rocky over me? Why him over ANYONE?&quot; Min-Ji groans. &quot;I can&#39;t believe they&#39;re keeping him as a meat shield. Well guess what, you&#39;re going to need it when you lose again! What a bunch of snakes.&quot;//]

&lt;span class=&#39;episode&#39;&gt;[[Introduction&lt;-Back to Title Page]]&lt;/span&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Cast Release" tags="" position="418,91" size="100,100">(set: $crazy to (colour: #33ff33))
A young, blond-haired man wearing a buttoned blue jacket shuffled through some papers. He was sitting behind a desk with two empty chairs across from him. A folder in front of him had the label &quot;Profiles - 3&quot;.

$v[&quot;I think I have everything ready,&quot;] he said. He looked up to address the camera. $v[&quot;Viewers, I believe the third season is upon us. So, to help me show you all what you&#39;re in for, I&#39;ve brought in a special guest.&quot;] He looked behind the camera. $v[&quot;Come in!&quot;]

The camera swivelled so that the man was sitting on the left side of the screen. A TV screen was mounted to the wall now facing the camera. Another figure entered the view of the camera, this one with a humanoid body structure but otherwise resembling a gray cat. She was wearing a white and green baseball cap, a plain red t-shirt, and blue shorts. The tip of her tail dragged on the carpeted floor behind her as she walked casually to one of the empty chairs - now on the right side - and sat down.

&quot;Pleasure to be here again, Vincent,&quot; she said cheerfully.

$v[&quot;Pleasure to have you back,&quot;] Vincent replied. $v[&quot;In case you didn&#39;t know, I am Vincent Boucher, the host and associate producer of Survivor: Mint Version. Here with me today is Tipper Masterson, the sole survivor of our first season. She&#39;s here to help me comment on the cast for our third season.&quot;]

Tipper nodded. &quot;Inca Legacy, right?&quot;

$v[&quot;It is,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;Eighteen castaways in the highlands of eastern Peru. Not only are they fighting to survive in the wilderness, but they will be getting the tiniest glimpse of how some civilizations prospered in the exact same conditions.&quot;]

&quot;Wait a minute, will they be doing challenges or anything like that in actual native ruins?&quot; Tipper asked.

$v[&quot;We have a dynamic cast in store for you all,&quot;] Vincent said, ignoring Tipper, $v[&quot;and we&#39;ve prepared just enough surprises to keep both the players and the audience on their toes. Let&#39;s not waste any more time.&quot;]

&quot;You nailed that introduction,&quot; said Tipper. &quot;You didn&#39;t stumble over your words or miss something even once.&quot;

Vincent crumpled a piece of paper and tossed it at Tipper. It bounced off her nose and fell into her lap.

&quot;Hey, rude.&quot;

$v[&quot;You sure are.&quot;] Vincent smirked, and shook his head.

Quite suddenly the pair noticed a strange shade of green emanating from the wall. A loud bang was heard, and on the wall appeared a circular green wormhole.

Vincent looked nonchalantly at the wormhole. $v[&quot;You’ve got to be kidding me,&quot;] he sighed. $v[&quot;I thought I told him none of that wormholey sci-fi sh-&quot;]

Two figures exploded out of the wormhole, one wearing a purple buttoned up shirt with a matching cap and blue jean shorts. He lost his hat upon entering revealing a smooth head of no hair. His eyes darted back and forth, looking anxious after the experience.

The second figure appeared halfway out of the wormhole, grinning like a slasher villain and adorned with goggles over his eyes and blazing green hair.

$crazy[&quot;Hot diggity!&quot;] said the green clad lad. $crazy[&quot;That’s how you travel!&quot;]

The young bald man looked more annoyed than grateful as he brushed his hat. &quot;You know, I really think you need to stop assuming people enjoy traveling like that!&quot;

$crazy[&quot;Ahhh, c’mon!&quot;] said the green haired man. $crazy[&quot;You were running late. This was the only way to get you here on time!&quot;]

$v[&quot;He’s //my// guest, cRaZy,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;He has the address, there’s nothing wrong with him getting here on his own two feet.&quot;] He looked down at his desk. $v[&quot;And now my files are blown all across the room.&quot;]

The green man just shrugged his shoulders and shook his head. $crazy[&quot;Yeah, yeah, whatever.&quot;] He then turned and looked back up. $crazy[&quot;Say, I was gonna go get a slurpee! Does anyone want one?&quot;]

&quot;We’re GOOD, thanks.&quot; The purple kid groaned. &quot;I’ll call you when this is over!&quot;

$crazy[&quot;Suit yourself, buddy.&quot;] cRaZy bowed over-dramatically, then turned around and dove deeper into the vortex. The wormhole closed with a pants zipper sound.

&quot;Man, that guy is so strange...&quot; sighed the young man.

$v[&quot;Well, you’re here, Oliver, and that’s the important part.&quot;] Vincent gestured to the empty seat next to Tipper, before turning to the camera. $v[&quot;We also have Oliver Oreals here with us. He was the runner-up of last season, Survivor: Shuffle Island. Now, let&#39;s start off with the first castaway.&quot;]
The TV turned on, first displaying the season logo before switching to a picture of an attractive young woman with long blonde hair, vibrant green eyes, and a glowing smile. She was wearing a diamond necklace, and she appeared to be wearing a light pink top. (The photo did not show below her chest, which would reveal it to be a short dress.)

&#39;&#39;Ashleia Berns
$o[thebigJET]&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Ashleia is a model who has a strategy of being adaptable and independent,&quot;] said Vincent, $v[&quot;but she&#39;ll most likely have some trouble fitting in. See, she&#39;s a very wealthy person, and has been her whole life. She knows what to expect coming onto the show, but she&#39;s totally out of touch when it comes to what her tribemates see as necessities and luxuries. Ashleia will need to rely on her caring personality, and possibly her good looks, if she wants to be taken seriously.&quot;]

&quot;Hmm, I want to think she has a chance if she can remain on the positive side of things, but if she starts prattling on about needless things, I can see where that can get really old, really quick.&quot; Oliver said, stroking his chin.

&quot;I have a feeling she&#39;s going to come down with a bad case of foot-in-mouth disease,&quot; said Tipper. &quot;If she&#39;s as naive as she looks, she will undoubtedly rub at least someone the wrong way, and I won&#39;t be surprised if the &#39;she doesn&#39;t need the money&#39; card comes into play.&quot;

Vincent picked up a clicker on the desk and pushed the button. A picture of the next castaway appeared. He was a college-aged male with a round face, dark blond hair, and blue eyes. He was wearing a gray t-shirt bearing the name of his university in blue and white. He looked very serious.

&#39;&#39;Buddy McLeod
$c[minty2mayhem]&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Buddy has two sides to him. On the outside is a grumpy, cold, and defensive guy who only looks out for himself.&quot;] Vincent sighed. $v[&quot;But on the inside, Buddy is very sensitive and hates seeing others inflict pain. He&#39;s an idealist, and he vows that this season won&#39;t be as dark as the one you were on.&quot;] He looked at Tipper when he said this.

&quot;Those don&#39;t exactly sound like compatible personalities,&quot; said Tipper. &quot;At least he doesn&#39;t sound like a self-righteous and hypocritical hero. Those are not fun to watch get their way.&quot;

$v[&quot;Who says that his strategy is foolproof?&quot;] Vincent replied. $v[&quot;I can confidently say that this season is going to put Buddy&#39;s confidence to the test.&quot;]

&quot;I have been in a lot of pressure situations from ORGs and Survivor seasons myself,&quot; said Oliver. &quot;In one of my philosophy classes I remember hearing a quote that went like this: &#39;If thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee.&#39; Let&#39;s just hope he doesn&#39;t let his ideals lead him astray.&quot;

&quot;I have no idea what the relevance of that is, but okay,&quot; said Tipper.

Vincent hit the clicker button again. The next castaway was another college-aged person, this one a woman with tan skin and brown eyes, but bright blonde hair. She was wearing a long-sleeved, sky blue shirt. Her wavy, shoulder-length hair was brushed over her hairline in one direction, rather than parting in the middle.

&#39;&#39;Candace Breyer
$o[minty2mayhem]&#39;&#39;

&quot;Aww, she looks cute.&quot; Oliver smiled. &quot;I like her.&quot;

$v[&quot;Candace is something of a philosopher herself. She is very relaxed and approachable, and believes that to succeed in the game, she can&#39;t let anything get under her skin,&quot;] Vincent explained.

&quot;Oh, wow, I&#39;m yawning already,&quot; said Tipper.

$v[&quot;Save it,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;Her biggest struggle so far is that she&#39;s a recovering drug addict, and she feels that a change of lifestyle will be able to give her a new perspective on living a clean life.&quot;]

&quot;Leading a new lifestyle choice is one thing, going cold turkey into a reality show might have a whole load of repercussions that I really don&#39;t want to think about.&quot; Oliver gulped. &quot;If she can manage to somehow not let her past haunt her she might have a really incredible growth story... I&#39;ll root for her and hope for the best.&quot;

Vincent hit the clicker button, and when he saw the next person he nearly sighed. The next castaway was another young woman with long brown hair, a slim physique and light brown eyes. She had a short pink tee, and a beaming smile.

&#39;&#39;Denine Magro
$c[minty2mayhem]&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Ah, Denine, she has so much enthusiasm I don&#39;t know where to start for her,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;She seems really into being on the show and pulling off moves and having a good time... there&#39;s nobody that I can say is readier for the show than she is.&quot;]

&quot;Hopefully she does more than just spout trivia the whole time,&quot; said Tipper, picking up a paperclip, &quot;or this is going straight into my eyeball.&quot;

&quot;Hmm...&quot; Oliver said, leaning into the image to inspect it carefully. &quot;I don&#39;t know about her. Being a fan of a show is one thing, being OUT THERE is a whole other kettle of fish entirely. I will say she probably won&#39;t last very long.&quot;

$v[&quot;The two of you are both only really seeing one side of her fan status,&quot;] Vincent replied. $v[&quot;There&#39;s more to her than that, but I would like to leave that as a surprise for now.&quot;]

&quot;Well I hope she proves me wrong then, because right now I have doubts.&quot; Oliver shrugged.

Vincent smiled, and clicked his clicker. The next castaway was yet another young woman, this one with long, bright blonde hair and green eyes. She was wearing a red and black plaid jacket, and she looked smug.

&#39;&#39;Jackie Potato
$q[meme12rose]&#39;&#39;

&quot;She looks familiar,&quot; said Tipper.

$v[&quot;I was wondering if you would notice,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;This is Jackie, the twin sister of Emily from your season. Like her sister, she is stubborn and cliquey, but that is about where the similarities end.&quot;]

&quot;Oh wow, a sibling on a new season?&quot; said Oliver, intrigued. &quot;I always like to compare and contrast relatives when they play on separate seasons.&quot;

$v[&quot;Putting them on the same season would be too cliché if you ask me,&quot;] Vincent replied. $v[&quot;Jackie prides herself on her strategic ability and is willing to do anything to get to the end. She&#39;s totally willing to be labeled the villain if it means she&#39;s playing the game right. I even remember her saying &#39;my game is going to be Inca Legacy, not Emily&#39;s Legacy.&#39;&quot;]

&quot;Hmmm...&quot; Oliver said after hearing that statement. &quot;I mean confidence can take people only SO FAR. I would hope she isn&#39;t all bark, but with a statement like that now I am starting to get early boot vibes from her.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m about confident she&#39;s going to shoot herself in the foot somewhere along the line. There&#39;s no way that she doesn&#39;t have at least something in common with Emily,&quot; said Tipper.

&quot;I agree.&quot; Oliver nodded.

Vincent chuckled, and pressed the button on his clicker. The next castaway was a fairly young man with dark skin and short black hair. He was wearing a red and white sports jersey, and he looked slightly surprised.

&#39;&#39;Jarrett Wayne
$o[minty2mayhem]&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Jarrett is a very blunt man, and he&#39;s not afraid to speak for his allies,&quot;] Vincent explained. $v[&quot;He doesn&#39;t like to bend to other people&#39;s wills, and he is determined to be an influential person himself.&quot;]

&quot;So, will he be trying to step up and lead, or does he just not want to be told what to do?&quot; Tipper asked. &quot;Depending on what his tribe pans out to be, one of those strategies will work out for him and the other one spells early boot.&quot;

&quot;I do see potential in him becoming a force of nature on his team,&quot; said Oliver, &quot;the question is will he be one of good or bad. I will say he&#39;s probably going to lean more on the antagonistic than the heroic.&quot;

Vincent shrugged and pressed the button on his clicker. The next castaway was a college-aged woman with medium-length brown hair and dark brown eyes. Her hair was mostly brushed over to her left side. She was wearing a denim jacket over a white undershirt, and she was smirking in her picture.

&#39;&#39;Jennifer Prince
$c[minty2mayhem]&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Jennifer doesn&#39;t take crap from anyone,&quot;] Vincent explained. $v[&quot;She&#39;s a wannabe leader who doesn&#39;t like conflict, but she&#39;s aware of her team dynamics. She will act for the good of her tribe, but she doesn&#39;t always see how strong she comes across.&quot;]

&quot;If I had any advice for her, it&#39;d be to pull back on the reins a little bit,&quot; Oliver pointed out. &quot;No one likes to be babysat, even if said watcher had good intentions. I think she might accidentally cause the powder keg to blow if she doesn&#39;t pick her battles correctly.&quot;

&quot;Who&#39;s to say her intentions are any good?&quot; Tipper replied. &quot;The good of the tribe isn&#39;t always the best way to go. You shouldn&#39;t be afraid to take a stand against the authority if said authority is a pile of garbage.&quot;

$v[&quot;Still bitter, are we?&quot;] Vincent asked, smirking a little.

Oliver just shuddered.

Vincent pressed the button on his clicker. The next castaway was wearing an indigo hood, and something with a brown strap. The whites of his black eyes were visible, but not even the profile of his face could be distinguished from the shadow underneath his hood.

&#39;&#39;Khall
$q[SSBFreak]&#39;&#39;

&quot;That might be the goofiest ninja I have ever seen.&quot; Oliver snickered at the big eyed hooded figure.

$v[&quot;How did you know he was- nevermind.&quot;] Vincent shook his head. $v[&quot;This is Khall... he&#39;s a bit of a goofball. He&#39;s very physically adept, but most of the time he just fails to get that across, so he looks more like a liability than an asset. He&#39;s not the sharpest tool in the shed, and he has an affinity for standing on inappropriately located flora and babbling about story conventions.&quot;]

&quot;I can&#39;t think of anything to say here, but...&quot; Tipper held her head in utter confusion.

&quot;As much fun as his personality might be, I am going to assume his unpredictable nature might just rub too many people the wrong way. As fun as it would be to see him bouncing around the place I don&#39;t see him lasting very long unfortunately.&quot; Oliver sighed.

Vincent clicked his clicker, revealing the next castaway: a young woman with platinum blonde hair, bright blue eyes, and a sweet smile. She was wearing a light blue top with spaghetti straps.

&#39;&#39;Lisa Peters
$c[minty2mayhem]&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Lisa is a very kind and respectful person, and she wants to prove that it&#39;s possible to win without making enemies,&quot;] Vincent explained. $v[&quot;She may appear to be a naive and innocent angel, but she is not afraid to take matters into her own hands and tell people what she wants them to do.&quot;]

&quot;I like her too,&quot; said Oliver. &quot;I find her spunky and she probably has the potential to be a real heroine of the season. I hope she can last long enough to see it through.&quot;

&quot;At least she&#39;s not expecting to get by on being pretty and non-threatening,&quot; said Tipper. &quot;If you&#39;re going to get on the show, at least try and play.&quot;

Vincent nodded. $v[&quot;Exactly.&quot;] He pressed his clicker and the next castaway appeared. This one was the first nonhuman of the cast, a pudgy anthropomorphic otter. He had dark brown eyes, a black and white visor, and an open blue jacket. His expression was a neutral one, as if he was getting a driver&#39;s license.

&#39;&#39;Louie Leingartner
$c[minty2mayhem]&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Louie may be a chubby surfing otter, three traits that correspond to cheerfulness, but Louie is not that,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;He&#39;s a very determined and stoic guy who finds himself most comfortable in a competitive environment. Arguably, his physical ability will be what determines whether he will go down swinging or make a real impact on the game.&quot;]

&quot;It&#39;s strange... I mean I can tell this guy has a story to tell, but I bet it will be something unexpected.&quot; Oliver rubbed his chin in thought. &quot;I can see him be a breakout hero or villain this season, and in both camps I can see him playing either role really well. He&#39;s my dark horse pick for the win regardless of any alignment he fills out.&quot;

Tipper scratched the back of her head. &quot;He looks like the kind of guy who will fulfill the carefree stereotype to your face, and then backstab you for the most minor infraction. I hope for his sake that nobody pushes him to that point.&quot;

&quot;Bad experience with otters too?&quot; asked Oliver with a hint of sarcasm.

&quot;Wait until a panther comes up, then we&#39;ll talk,&quot; Tipper snapped.

&quot;....&quot; Oliver went deadpan and glared at the screen with his arms crossed. &quot;NEXT PLEASE!&quot;

Vincent rolled his eyes and pressed the clicker button. The next castaway was a young woman of Korean descent. She had brown eyes with glasses, black shoulder-length hair, and a green clip in her hair. She was wearing a dark yellow shirt, and she was smiling slightly.

&#39;&#39;Min-Ji Han
$o[minty2mayhem]&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Min-Ji claims that she&#39;s a natural born leader, and she wants to keep her tribe focused and organized,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;Unlike many so-called leaders, she knows her tribe won&#39;t necessarily be a functioning unit, and she&#39;s willing to jump into the fold of tribe politics to make moves that interest only her, and then make sure what&#39;s left can bounce back.&quot;]

&quot;She&#39;s a realist.&quot; Oliver pointed out. &quot;Having the foresight of knowing when to fight and who to fight alongside can be a crucial advantage for some players. I bet she&#39;ll have a solid couple of rounds, but if people start to catch on she&#39;ll be in for some rough waters ahead. I&#39;ll root for her though because it&#39;s nice to see someone who is going to stick to their guns as opposed to folding to another&#39;s demands.&quot;

&quot;I figure she might be able to go the distance if she distinguishes team leader Min-Ji from game player Min-Ji,&quot; said Tipper. &quot;Might be more difficult than I make it sound.&quot;

Vincent nodded and pressed the clicker button. The next castaway was certainly the oldest so far - a man who looked to be in his early fifties or so, with short, graying hair and blue eyes. He had an overweight build and a dull green buttoned jacket.

&#39;&#39;Monty
$q[CKD]&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Monty is probably one of my favourites in the cast,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;He&#39;s a good-natured Southern construction worker who wants to try something different and learn about himself. He&#39;s not going to worry himself much with strategy, he&#39;s just out here to make some good relationships and have some good stories to tell his pals back home.&quot;]

&quot;I don&#39;t see him going far enough in running challenges, let alone in the competition,&quot; said Tipper. &quot;I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll have a great week or two in Peru, though.&quot;

&quot;Contrary to my associate, I have high hopes for Monty.&quot; Oliver grinned. &quot;An older guy with a easy going nature might just be what his tribe needs to stay sane. I mean, will it get him a win? I can believe he has the skills and personality to make a very solid end game resume among his peers. I think he&#39;s also in my top four to win.&quot;

&quot;I think his fellow competitors will be more like his kids&#39; peers than his own,&quot; said Tipper.

&quot;How did you win your season again?&quot; Oliver rubbed his temples.

Vincent sighed and pressed the button on his clicker. The next contestant was a college-aged woman with wavy black hair and brown eyes. She had a tan skin colour that suggested she was of Hispanic descent. She was wearing a green t-shirt, and she had a calm smile.

&#39;&#39;Paula Cortes
$q[minty2mayhem]&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Paula has a good head on her shoulders, but other than that I don&#39;t even think she knows what she&#39;s going to do,&quot;] said Vincent, stifling a laugh. $v[&quot;She says that she&#39;s going to assess everyone and try to play an intelligent game, but she has trouble under pressure. She could do well if she isn&#39;t caught off guard, I think.&quot;]

&quot;I&#39;m cool with that, as long as it doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s going to dominate this season and play everyone like a fiddle,&quot; said Tipper. &quot;For our sake, I hope she runs into something unexpected that throws her off and shakes up her game.&quot;

&quot;I mean she seems to have an idea how to play the game, but if her anxiety is really that big of a deal then her biggest obstacle will probably be herself,&quot; Oliver pointed out. &quot;If any conflict should arise from this season, most likely she&#39;ll be the one who inadvertently starts it.&quot;

Vincent nodded and clicked his clicker. The next castaway was a light-skinned young man with blond hair slicked back, and green eyes. He was wearing a blue and purple plaid shirt that looked a bit too wide for him. He looked contemplative.

&#39;&#39;Rhett Mason
$c[DoctorRoy]&#39;&#39;

&quot;I can appreciate a man in purple.&quot; Oliver smirked.

$v[&quot;Rhett is a cool, collected young man who thrives in social situations,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;He&#39;s a fan of debate, and he thinks that deep discussions are the best way to get to know a person&#39;s true character. If he can&#39;t do that, then he has trouble trusting them.&quot;]

&quot;I think he has potential to be a schemer of the season.&quot; Oliver said. &quot;I also get the impression that if he were to get a vote thrown at him, he might go on a witch hunt. I just hope he&#39;s not unbearable out there if he really focuses on debating about morality and trust all the time.&quot;

&quot;He looks like a wannabe used car salesman,&quot; said Tipper. &quot;You start out talking about where to build the shelter, and before you know it you&#39;re in a final two alliance and you&#39;re $50,000 in debt.&quot;

$v[&quot;There&#39;s a story there,&quot;] said Vincent. He pressed the button on his clicker. The next contestant was an anthro skunk wearing sunglasses and a black leather jacket over a red shirt. He appeared to be really annoyed about something.

&#39;&#39;Rocky
$o[Tinyhammer]&#39;&#39;

&quot;Say, Oliver, you&#39;re not going to be bitter about skunks too, are you?&quot; Tipper asked, half curious and half waiting for a reaction.

&quot;Only if they tie me to a pole and beat me.&quot; Oliver said not even looking at Tipper.

$v[&quot;We are NOT talking about that,&quot;] Vincent snapped. $v[&quot;Despite being about the same age as most of his competitors, Rocky here is very entitled and immature guy. His hobbies include partying, rock music, and booze. He picks fights with pretty much anyone, and he doesn&#39;t care what people think of him as long as he gets what he wants.&quot;]

&quot;Oh, he sounds like a saint.&quot; Oliver shook his head. &quot;The sooner his torch is snuffed the better.&quot;

&quot;I think I&#39;m in love,&quot; sighed Tipper. &quot;If there&#39;s a brain under there, I&#39;ll hope that he goes far and plays with people, just so everyone loses it when they don&#39;t see it coming.&quot;

&quot;Well I know a guy from Philly you might get along with if this falls through.&quot; Oliver chuckled.

&quot;I hope you&#39;re not talking about that living pit stain you call Brody,&quot; Tipper groaned.

&quot;Him? Of course not!&quot; Oliver then looked to Vincent and mouthed //&quot;I am totally talking about that guy!&quot;//

Vincent decided not to entertain this bitter feud and moved on to the next contestant. He was a male with short, light blond hair and pale skin. He was wearing a sky blue shirt, and appeared to be a human but with two large, soft blue wings behind his back. His eyes were closed, and he had a neutral, peaceful expression.

&#39;&#39;Saul
$o[minty2mayhem]&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;I was surprised that someone like Saul would want to compete on a reality show, but maybe that&#39;s a reason he signed up for this series in particular.&quot;] Vincent gave a half-shrug. $v[&quot;Saul&#39;s biggest strength is his ability to manage stress, which he hopes will serve him well in the competition. He frequently has visions, and although they tend to be vague, he says, they might give him a leg up in determining whether he&#39;s going along the right track.&quot;]

&quot;I see,&quot; said Tipper. &quot;I&#39;m hoping he turns out to be the proactive type. If he doesn&#39;t get caught up in the hustle and bustle of the game, and he does nothing to change how it plays out, then he might as well not be playing at all.&quot;

Oliver nodded. &quot;He looks like the quiet type, though... but I&#39;m going to hold out hope.&quot;

Vincent pressed the button on his clicker, revealing the second-to-last castaway. She was a young anthro rabbit with gray fur and dark green eyes. She was wearing a black t-shirt with a white outline of two dice on it. She was smiling brightly.

&#39;&#39;Tara Grey
$q[minty2mayhem]&#39;&#39;

$v[&quot;Tara is a friendly, outgoing girl who likes to show off,&quot;] explained Vincent. $v[&quot;Her hobby is magic, and she hopes that she can impress her team to help form initial relationships with them. She knows she&#39;s not the strongest player, but she wants to make up for it in charisma and a little sass.&quot;]

&quot;I have a feeling she&#39;s going to be the underdog type who gets by through being a positive force on her team that everyone wants to be friends with,&quot; Tipper suggested. &quot;I don&#39;t know if she&#39;ll able to avoid being seen as dangerous if she depends on this strategy too much.&quot;

&quot;The only way I can see someone so positive getting eliminated early is if she&#39;s on a tribe of complete jerks.&quot; Oliver nodded. &quot;I am hoping that isn&#39;t the case because I am sure she can be a really rootable player if she can make it far enough… yes she&#39;s also a top contender for me.&quot; he smiled.

$v[&quot;And that brings us to the last contestant of the season,&quot;] said Vincent. He pressed the button on his clicker, and the TV screen flashed red.

&quot;Wait, what&#39;s happening?&quot; Tipper asked.

&quot;Oh god....&quot; Oliver stood up from his chair looking hella scared right now.

$v[&quot;That&#39;s weird,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;This calls for some percussive maintenance.&quot;] He stood up from his chair, walked over to the TV and smacked it once with the clicker.

The screen returned to its normal colours, but the final castaway was only a black silhouette...

...but it cleared up to reveal a man in his mid-twenties with short brown hair, glasses, and a five o&#39;clock shadow. He was wearing a bright blue shirt, and his green eyes showed how anxious he was.

&#39;&#39;Václav Beránek
$q[minty2mayhem]&#39;&#39;

&quot;Oh, thank goodness...&quot; Oliver sighed in relief. &quot;Just some kid who looks like he wet himself.&quot;

$v[&quot;Oliver, sit down,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;Václav is an intelligent man who sometimes gets caught up in his ideas, good or bad. He says he is prepared for the strategic aspect of the game, but he has to be wary of his tendency to overthink things, but my worry is that he&#39;s going to be more concerned of literally everything else. Václav might be a huge threat if he would just take a deep breath once in awhile.&quot;]

&quot;Looks like he&#39;s going to be a complete disaster,&quot; said Tipper. &quot;However, where he differs from Sly is that Václav looks like he has a backbone, so he isn&#39;t doomed to goat status, and might even get targeted for simply having a good day.&quot;

&quot;Well now I feel bad for saying that aboot him.&quot; Oliver frowned. &quot;I hope he does manage to find his way in this crazy game somehow, and if he doesn&#39;t win I hope he can at the very least grow from the experience.&quot;

Vincent clicked his clicker one last time, revealing the cast of 18 sitting and standing on the steps of what appeared to be a temple of some kind.

$v[&quot;So, any thoughts, questions, concerns?&quot;] said Vincent.

&quot;Yeah, are these actual ancient ruins or just props?&quot; Tipper asked. &quot;I really hope you guys aren&#39;t romping around in places with historical and archaeological value.&quot;

$v[&quot;No comment. Oliver, any questions?&quot;] Vincent asked, slightly annoyed.

&quot;A few, will there be any special gimmicks, twists, advantages distributed this season?&quot; asked the purple clad Canadian.

$v[&quot;Actually yes,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;Right out the gate, each tribe is presented with a choice that will have an impact on whether their tribe is truly successful. We&#39;re also bringing back two big twists to make this game a truly hectic experience - kidnapping, and One World. We even have another twist that wasn&#39;t even planned by production!&quot;]

&quot;Wow.&quot; Oliver said, his interest piqued. &quot;I look forward to see what kind of shake ups you have in store for this season.&quot; He gave a thumbs-up.

&quot;What is this twist you didn&#39;t plan?&quot; Tipper asked.

$v[&quot;If we told you, then it wouldn&#39;t be as surprising to you as it was to us,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;You&#39;ll have to wait and see. Anything else you wanted to ask?&quot;]

&quot;Yes, when will this season commence?&quot; Oliver said, looking back up at the full cast picture.

Vincent shrugged.

&quot;Well then, let&#39;s see how it plays out! I am eager to see how the game goes!&quot; Oliver nodded in approval.

&quot;Yeah, me too, surprisingly enough,&quot; said Tipper.

$v[&quot;That&#39;s good to hear, I&#39;m glad that you&#39;re on board,&quot;] Vincent said, smiling. $v[&quot;Thanks for coming out, guys, I appreciate it.&quot;]

&quot;Anytime,&quot; said Tipper. Oliver nodded in agreement.

$v[&quot;Well, hopefully you at home will enjoy the season as well,&quot;] said Vincent. $v[&quot;You know what they say, third time&#39;s the charm, right?]

&#39;&#39;An Hour Later&#39;&#39;

The TV was off, as were all the lights. The room was completely empty, as Vincent had returned to his office, and Tipper and Oliver had headed home.

A green wormhole materialized on the wall, and with a loud boom, a familiar-looking man in green stepped out holding a tray of four coloured drinks.

$crazy[&quot;I got everyone slurpees!&quot;] cRaZy exclaimed. $crazy[&quot;I know you said you didn&#39;t want any, but deep down I knew-&quot;]

He realized he was alone in the room, and his face immediately dropped.

Candace lets out a sigh. &quot;After joy comes sadness, and after defeat comes triumph. The universe is a cycle of cycles, we shall find our joy again in time.&quot;

&quot;I agree with whatever that means,&quot; says Ashleia.

//&quot;Today wasn&#39;t ideal,&quot; Candace explains. &quot;We still have Rocky being an irritant, but at least we don&#39;t have Min-Ji here anymore. She might have been more trouble than she was worth down the line, I feel. Make no mistake, though, Rocky should be next.&quot;//

Saul taps Paula on the shoulder, and shuffles aside to talk to her quietly.

&quot;What&#39;s the matter, Saul?&quot; Paula asks.

&quot;I am sad about Min-Ji leaving, as now I remain the only one who voted against Rocky,&quot; Saul explains. &quot;I would like the perspective of someone who did not have an agenda tonight. What happened?&quot;

&quot;The others thought Min-Ji was going to be a more dangerous threat if they kept her,&quot; Paula replies. &quot;It sounds like everyone is a more dangerous threat than Rocky though, if what I&#39;m hearing from everyone is true.&quot;

Saul shakes his head. &quot;I do not believe so. There is more to Rocky, and I can sense it. It is truthfully why I wanted him out.&quot;

Paula raises her eyebrows. &quot;That little punk? You think he could be a bigger threat down the road?&quot;

Saul nods. &quot;I believe that if he is not eliminated, his power will only grow. My visions inform me that the least tactful, the most ambitious and egotistical among us has the capability to outlast us all. I struggle to see that being anyone besides Rocky.&quot;

&quot;Maybe Jackie,&quot; says Paula. &quot;She&#39;s trying too hard to be a mastermind that it&#39;s actually kind of painful to watch her crash and burn.&quot;

//&quot;I definitely see Monty and Vaclav as being better for me down the road than Jackie and Khall,&quot; Paula admits. &quot;The guys are rational and friendly, while Khall is unreadable and I think that if I flip to Jackie then she might turn on me because she needs a &#39;big move&#39;.&quot;//

&quot;So, you have your own Rocky, in a way, on Quibas?&quot; Saul asks. &quot;Well, if you are so inclined, I would be willing to support you in dealing with her shall we end up voting together.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m all for a backroom deal.&quot; Paula smirks. &quot;Welcome to the club.&quot;

//&quot;Ochora, I fear, has consigned me to an unpleasant fate,&quot; says Saul. &quot;Therefore, I have no choice but to reach out to the other tribes in search of a more favourable position. Now my focus becomes surviving long enough to gain contact with them.&quot;//

Jarrett, Ashleia, and Candace regroup to have a quick conversation of their own.

&quot;I gotta hand it to you girls,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;That was some impressive sniping we just did.&quot;

&quot;Min-Ji was becoming unbearable,&quot; says Candace. &quot;It was only fitting, I believe.&quot;

Ashleia nodded. &quot;Like, once I realized she would lie to get Rocky out, even though that was already our plan, then why wouldn&#39;t she lie about any of us?&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;She wouldn&#39;t hesitate to do so.&quot;

//&quot;I don&#39;t care about the lying, that&#39;s part of the game,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;But if that makes her a target in the eyes of others, that&#39;s good for me. She was a threat, and now I&#39;m left with people I&#39;m less wary of. It&#39;s good to have some breathing room.&quot;//

Rocky&#39;s eyes dart back and forth between the two conversations, before he turns and sprints back to camp.

//&quot;I&#39;m aware of how close I was to leaving tonight,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;If it wasn&#39;t for Ashleia, I would have been sweating bullets. But I&#39;m still here, and my number one priority is getting a better spot for myself or getting an idol. Either will work.&quot;//

$c[**Chalpe**]

Buddy is sitting by himself, watching the tribe&#39;s pot over the fire, when Louie comes over and sits down near him.

//&quot;I know Buddy figures he&#39;s on the outs,&quot; says Louie, &quot;but as long as we keep winning I&#39;d rather he doesn&#39;t snap and go serial killer on all of us.&quot;//

&quot;What are you thinking about?&quot; Louie asks.

&quot;Home,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;It&#39;s been all I&#39;ve been able to think about since yesterday. I know we&#39;ve been doing well but it&#39;s still tough, especially on a tribe I&#39;m not comfortable with.&quot;

Louie nods. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m not comfortable with this group either. But if we can just make it to the swap we should be good.&quot;

&quot;What if it&#39;s a tribe dissolve, and all we get is two new people?&quot; Buddy suggests. &quot;That would suck.&quot;

//&quot;Louie, I guess, wanted to just look like he wasn&#39;t a non-entity at camp who does nothing but follow Denine,&quot; Buddy guesses. &quot;It&#39;s not fooling me, though. I was throwing veiled insults about how much I can&#39;t stand him the whole time, and I wouldn&#39;t be shocked if he did the same thing.&quot;//

&quot;What if it isn&#39;t?&quot; Louie replies. &quot;We might end up losing... speaking of which. Who would you be voting out if it came to that?&quot;

Buddy stops, thinks for a moment, then rubs the back of his neck. &quot;I&#39;m not sure, honestly. It&#39;s not obvious to me.&quot;

Louie&#39;s eyes narrow. &quot;There isn&#39;t one person you have on your radar?&quot;

Buddy shakes his head. &quot;Like I said. I&#39;m not comfortable here. I&#39;m fine with whatever.&quot;

//&quot;He must be wanting me out if he says he doesn&#39;t like anyone but not naming any names,&quot; says Louie. &quot;Well, I&#39;m glad we had this little chat then, because it&#39;ll be our last before I send him packing.&quot;//

Just then, Lisa approaches the pair. &quot;Thanks for watching the pot for me, Buddy,&quot; Lisa says sweetly.

&quot;Watching the pot?&quot; Buddy raises an eyebrow. &quot;I got the water on in the first place.&quot;

&quot;We both did,&quot; says Lisa, frowning slightly.

&quot;You watched from a distance,&quot; Buddy replies.

&quot;Both of you shut up,&quot; Louie snaps. &quot;This is by far the dumbest argument I&#39;ve heard since I got here.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s about the principle of it,&quot; Buddy interjects.

//&quot;I don&#39;t understand why Buddy has to be so upset all the time,&quot; says Lisa, with a frown. &quot;It&#39;s really unfortunate. The only one he&#39;s harming is himself. I do hope the tribe recognizes that we need to vote him out for his sake, and ours too.&quot;//

Denine then arrives. &quot;Um, what&#39;s going on here? Who started it?&quot;

&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; says Louie, before Buddy or Lisa can get a word in.

&quot;Hi, Denine!&quot; Lisa says brightly. &quot;We were not arguing, just preparing dinner for us.&quot;

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s nice!&quot; Denine smiles. &quot;So, there&#39;s no problem here? I thought I heard Louie say there was an argument.&quot;

&quot;Do not worry, it&#39;s all settled now.&quot; Lisa says. &quot;I do not believe Buddy will have another snit over semantics today.&quot;

&quot;He got worked up over word choice? Wow, that&#39;s low, even for him.&quot; Denine shakes her head.

&quot;For someone you supposedly despise, you have a high opinion of him,&quot; says Louie.

Denine shoots Louie a quick glare. &quot;It shouldn&#39;t matter, we&#39;re still voting him out first.&quot;

&quot;I think he left,&quot; says Lisa. &quot;It is not like we have to fret about his presence.&quot;

//&quot;Yeah I pretty much hate everyone here,&quot; says Denine. &quot;Am I going to wear it on my sleeve like Buddy? Hell no, I want to stay in the competition. If that means playing Lisa&#39;s little game until I decide to cut her loose, then I suppose I have to do that.&quot;//

//&quot;Denine and Louie are thick as thieves,&quot; says Lisa. &quot;Rhett and Jennifer seem to trust each other. I would like both sides to see me as an asset, so I am most delighted that Denine is willing to humour me.&quot;//

$q[**Quibas**]

Monty, Vaclav, and Paula are sitting near the shelter together, listening to Monty tell a story.

&quot;So, after a few hours of waiting, me an&#39; the boys was about to head home. We got a few little ones, maybe that&#39;s all the lake had,&quot; says Monty. &quot;But then I see Mitch strugglin&#39; to not fall over. He says &#39;I got one, pop! I got one!&#39;  I help him reel the sucker in, and once I saw it we was stunned.&quot;

&quot;What was it?&quot; Vaclav asks. &quot;Was it even a fish?&quot;

&quot;Oh, it wasn&#39;t a boot or a tire, they don&#39;t squirm like this feller did,&quot; says Monty with a chuckle. &quot;It was the biggest trout me an&#39; my boys ever did see! A real beauty, that one. Almost the size of the rabbit girl.&quot;

&quot;She wasn&#39;t exactly small,&quot; says Paula.

&quot;Well, neither was the trout!&quot;

//&quot;Monty may not be the best storyteller in the world, but I like listening to him tell his little tales about fishing and dirt biking and his other backwoods escapades,&quot; says Paula. &quot;Maybe it&#39;s the country girl in me saying this, but it&#39;s one of the best things out here for me.&quot;//

&quot;Hey, um, I&#39;m sorry to interrupt,&quot; Vaclav says with a bit of a blush. &quot;But, um, do you guys get worried that we&#39;re alienating the rest of the tribe?&quot;

Monty&#39;s jovial expression dims slightly. &quot;What&#39;s got you down, son?&quot;

&quot;Vaclav, if they want to be a part of this then they can,&quot; says Paula. &quot;But I&#39;m not going to waste my time chasing them down.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just worried about things, I guess,&quot; Vaclav admits.

&quot;Let&#39;s... not let the game get us down right now,&quot; says Monty.

Paula nods, her face showing a tinge of worry.

&quot;Oh. Sorry for making things awkward,&quot; says Vaclav.

//&quot;I shouldn&#39;t have said anything.&quot; Vaclav wipes his nose with his hand. &quot;I don&#39;t know if they want me to calm down because they don&#39;t want me worked up over nothing, or because they want me to let my guard down. If it&#39;s the latter, that will never happen.&quot;//

//&quot;He&#39;s a good kid, I trust him,&quot; says Monty. &quot;He just... thinks too hard. We&#39;re here to have a good time, right? It might help if we can win a massage reward for him or somethin&#39;, I dunno.&quot;//

$o[**Ochora**]

Ashleia, Candace, and Jarrett decided to hold an alliance meeting a short distance away from camp.

&quot;They know the area better than we do,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;Are you sure they know how to get here?&quot;

Ashleia sighs. &quot;There&#39;s... not much of a way for them to get lost, is there?&quot;

As if on cue, the trio are greeted by their guests – $q[Jackie] and $q[Khall], arriving from the Quibas camp.

&quot;My tribe is distracted with &#39;bonding&#39; or something,&quot; says Jackie, making air quotes with her hands as she says &#39;bonding&#39;. &quot;How about yours?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; Jarrett replies. &quot;You see we have three of us here, there are five on our tribe...&quot;

&quot;So what&#39;s going on?&quot; Jackie asks. &quot;You want to make some kind of deal?&quot;

//&quot;Jackie seems like the one player who&#39;s taking this game more seriously than anyone,&quot; Jarrett explains. &quot;I figured it would be good to work out some kind of a deal with her.&quot;//

&quot;We may fly our own colours,&quot; says Candace, &quot;but we can stand together under a banner of one colour... the human colour.&quot;

Ashleia scratches her head, confused.

&quot;Cross-tribal alliance,&quot; says Jarrett bluntly. &quot;If you two can make it to the swap, we&#39;ll have your backs. Chalpe might be too strong to take on if we&#39;re fighting amongst each other.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not, like, the only reason,&quot; Ashleia replies. &quot;See, we have a problem and his name is Rocky. So if we don&#39;t lose, can you guys help and vote him out?&quot;

Both Jackie and Khall nod.

&quot;Is there anyone on your side that, like, we can try getting rid of for you?&quot; Ashleia asks. &quot;So we can do a sort of... exchange?&quot;

Khall is about to say something but Jackie cuts him off.

&quot;All of them. I&#39;m not picky.&quot;

//&quot;They sure have a lot of guts to say &#39;okay, we&#39;ll protect with you, but vote out this guy only&#39;.&quot; Jackie shakes her head. &quot;This Rocky guy looks kind of strong. So what if his tribe hates him? I don&#39;t.&quot;//

&quot;Can we trust you?&quot; Candace asks.

&quot;I like to think I&#39;m trustworthy,&quot; says Khall.

&quot;We don&#39;t have anything to lose,&quot; Jackie adds.

&quot;Is that so?&quot; says Jarrett.

//&quot;So that group may or may not be my backup when the swap hits,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;But if any of them are in danger over me, that&#39;s their problem. Oops, sorry, my hands are tied, there&#39;s nothing I can do.&quot;//

//&quot;Well, that was uneventful,&quot; says Khall. He shrugs.//

Buddy is angrily snapping twigs in his hands while mumbling to himself and walking in a circle. He almost doesn&#39;t notice Rhett walk by, carrying some branches for the fire.

&quot;Buddy, you all good?&quot; Rhett asks. &quot;You look aggravated.&quot;

&quot;Oh really, do I now?&quot; says Buddy, turning around with an icy glare. &quot;I&#39;ll give you three tries as to why.&quot;

&quot;Denine,&quot; Rhett guesses.

&quot;Not this time,&quot; says Buddy.

&quot;Louie.&quot;

&quot;Not him, either.&quot;

Rhett stops to think, scratching his head. &quot;Um... the fact that this is the only time in your life that your vote will ever count?&quot;

&quot;Lisa! It&#39;s that bottle blonde, prissy, passive aggressive head cheerleader BITCH!&quot; Buddy snaps.

&quot;What!? Why her?&quot; Rhett looks completely stunned by Buddy&#39;s outburst, more than he should be.

//&quot;I&#39;ve been absolutely fuming about her after that stupid lie I called her out on,&quot; Buddy explains. &quot;I need Jennifer and Rhett to see what&#39;s going on with her, I can&#39;t be the only one who thinks Lisa is full of it.&quot;//

&quot;You know, Denine sucks but at least she knows Survivor trivia, that might come in handy for a challenge,&quot; says Buddy.

&quot;You haven&#39;t gotten the chance to talk to her,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;Denine is really insightful.&quot;

&quot;Well that makes your choice easier, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; Buddy replies. &quot;The way I see it, you have two choices. It&#39;s either Lisa or Louie. Both of them are physically weak, but at least Louie can swim, and voting Lisa won&#39;t make Denine want to wring your neck.&quot;

&quot;Buddy, most of the tribe wants you gone.&quot; Rhett shakes his head. &quot;I&#39;m not going to put my neck on the line for you if it puts me in the minority.&quot;

&quot;It doesn&#39;t have to be the minority. We need to convince Jennifer.&quot;

//&quot;I admit. I haven&#39;t been paying enough attention to the dynamics,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;But if Jennifer and I are to stick together, we have to keep the other three good with us. If we vote Buddy or Lisa out, and lose again, what happens?&quot;//

Meanwhile, Lisa is watching the pair from afar.

&quot;Oh, no, this simply will not do,&quot; says Lisa. &quot;I need a plan. I desperately need to talk to Jennifer before they can.&quot;

//&quot;If Buddy convinces Rhett, then I need Jennifer on my side to be confident we do not kidnap a rabble-rouser,&quot; Lisa explains. &quot;I do hope she can see reason. I need to put an end to Buddy&#39;s smear campaign, so we can all sleep better at night.&quot;//

&quot;You simply must know that I cannot stand idly by and watch our group be torn asunder,&quot; Lisa insists to Jennifer. &quot;I saw Buddy trying to say... all these awful things about me.&quot;

&quot;He did?&quot; Jennifer raises an eyebrow. &quot;Why would he?&quot;

&quot;I have no clue why he wants to make this so personal.&quot; Lisa sighs. &quot;It is, after all, only a game, right?&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s not the only one who&#39;s taken this personally,&quot; Jennifer replies. &quot;Heck, just look at Denine. It takes two to tango.&quot;

&quot;I... I do not know how else to say it!&quot; Lisa clasps her hands together. &quot;Jennifer, listen to me. We have a simply inexcusable amount of grief and unpleasantries here. It is best for all of us if we stand together and vote out the one in the middle of it all.&quot;

&quot;And that would be Buddy.&quot;

//&quot;I sort of assumed that was Lisa&#39;s position from the start,&quot; says Jennifer, looking irritated. &quot;So why is she suddenly on my case about voting him out now?&quot;//

&quot;Alright. I&#39;m with you,&quot; says Jennifer.

&quot;Oh, thank you, I am so gracious!&quot; Lisa smiles brightly. &quot;Now, I must make my leave. I have other tasks to attend to. Ta!&quot; And with that, Lisa moves to return to camp.

Jennifer pauses, before walking after her.

$q[**Quibas**]

Paula is muttering to herself, rehearsing Survivor trivia in the event of a challenge.

//&quot;I need to stay sharp and be aware of my surroundings,&quot; Paula explains. &quot;Right now, the tribe is stable, but little things can add up over time. As much as I would like to at times, I can&#39;t shun anyone.&quot;//

When she sees Jackie coming back to camp from a walk, Paula gestures her over.

&quot;Hey, Jackie, you got a minute?&quot; she asks.

&quot;Sure, what&#39;s up?&quot; Jackie replies, flicking hair out of her eyes.

&quot;I&#39;ve noticed that you and Khall have been really close recently,&quot; Paula explains. &quot;And I don&#39;t want to say that&#39;s a good or a bad thing or what have you. But we do need to stick together as a tribe.&quot;

Jackie raises an eyebrow. &quot;We are sticking together, but I don&#39;t really want to give everyone equal time.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I get it, we all have our preferences,&quot; says Paula. &quot;We&#39;re in three tribes, though. That usually doesn&#39;t last long, so you&#39;re making the rest of us kind of nervous that you&#39;re going to screw us over.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t screw you over for no reason,&quot; says Jackie.

&quot;It&#39;s not you I&#39;m worried about,&quot; Paula admits, &quot;it&#39;s Khall who&#39;s the wildcard. Are you sure you can keep a leash on him?&quot;

//&quot;Khall is a good ally. Dim-witted, knows when to be quiet, doesn&#39;t bumble about and say the wrong things.&quot; Jackie smiles. &quot;We work well together – I act, he listens. All we need is a vote to show how we do things.&quot;//

&quot;Khall is with us,&quot; says Jackie firmly. &quot;We got this. You&#39;re not worried about the guys banding together, are you?&quot;

&quot;It never hurts to be sure,&quot; Paula replies. &quot;I like having multiple perspectives before I make a decision, and we&#39;re in a game of big decisions.&quot;

&quot;Speaking of Khall, have you seen him recently?&quot; Jackie asks.

&quot;Why,&quot; says Paula, &quot;where did you put him?&quot;

$o[**Ochora**]

Candace is standing near a tree, watching Rocky check under a multitude of rocks.

&quot;So,&quot; Rocky says, &quot;what happened with Jarrett and Ashleia yesterday? You were gone at the most bizarre of times.&quot;

&quot;Was I supposed to include you? Jarrett was trying to make sure that everyone else wants you out just as much,&quot; says Candace.

&quot;HA! Good luck with that.&quot;

//&quot;Right now, I&#39;m on make-sure-Rocky-has-no-idol duty,&quot; explains Candace. &quot;However, Rocky&#39;s inner spirits are in disarray, and I know if he finds that idol they will be soothed. I can tap into his aura and figure it out either way, but the tribe thinks someone HAS to be doing this.&quot;//

&quot;So, once I find this thing,&quot; says Rocky, &quot;which I will, who should we take out with it?&quot;

&quot;Why are you asking me?&quot; Candace asks. &quot;You&#39;re going to do whatever you want anyways.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not stupid,&quot; Rocky replies, &quot;I need to have **someone** on my side.&quot;

&quot;Rocky, we aren&#39;t allies!&quot; Candace snaps. &quot;Listen. I hate you as much as Jarrett does, as much as Saul does, as much as Ashleia does. You have no friends here.&quot;

&quot;Candace, we are allies,&quot; says Rocky. He stands up to face her. &quot;You **need** me. You see, Jarrett has this tribe by the nuts, and I&#39;m not going to stand for it. And seeing as you&#39;re the one on the bottom of the totem pole...&quot;

&quot;What!?&quot;

//&quot;I&#39;ve done nothing wrong since I got here and there&#39;s a cult that&#39;s after me,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;Jarrett&#39;s running the show, and if I can&#39;t get him to backstab someone else, I need to look for more than just an idol. Candace is my best bet since she&#39;s a nut.&quot;//

&quot;Who do you think will go home after me?&quot; Rocky says. &quot;Spoiler, it&#39;s either you or Saul. Jarrett&#39;s too strong and he&#39;s going to want to save Ashleia so he can bone her later. Plus, he&#39;s probably chumming it up with Saul while you&#39;re stuck here with me, so...&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll win without you,&quot; Candace replies.

Rocky smirks. &quot;I doubt it,&quot; he says while flexing his left bicep, &quot;believe it or not, this tribe – especially you – needs me.&quot;

//&quot;Jarrett knows I&#39;m the most capable of keeping Rocky in line, that&#39;s why he made me keep watch,&quot; says Candace. &quot;So Rocky can take his conspiracy theory crap and shove it.&quot;//

Candace rolls her eyes, and behind her enters Saul.

&quot;Are you two alright?&quot; Saul asks gently.

&quot;I&#39;ve been better,&quot; says Candace.

&quot;I don&#39;t doubt it,&quot; Rocky mutters under his breath.

&quot;How is the idol hunt going?&quot; asks Saul.

&quot;Why should I tell you? You voted against me last time,&quot; says Rocky.

&quot;I was talking to Candace,&quot; Saul replies.

//&quot;I believe Rocky has given up on his fruitless effort to hide his true self,&quot; Saul explains. &quot;I have no doubt that my darker prophesies refer to him, now. But of course, I cannot act on them alone.&quot;//

&quot;He hasn&#39;t found anything,&quot; says Candace. &quot;And I still don&#39;t think we should be patronizing Rocky like this.&quot;

&quot;I do not agree either.&quot; Saul folds his arms. &quot;But this is the only way to ease Jarrett and Ashleia&#39;s concerns.

&quot;Or the three of us could vote them out,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;He thinks he has the final say in how things are run around here, I say we stick it to him.&quot;

Candace looks over at Saul with a curious expression, but Saul gives no response.

&quot;It&#39;s... not a terrible idea,&quot; says Candace. &quot;But we really have to work on your aura.&quot;

&quot;Auras can&#39;t cast votes, sweetie,&quot; Rocky replies.

Saul looks a little annoyed by this remark. &quot;Hey, Rocky. I see no benefit to keeping you. If Jarrett is a threat, other tribes will want to eliminate him. But he is not causing us any harm.&quot;

Rocky&#39;s expression instantly sours. &quot;Just wait until YOUR backs are on the line, because mark my words, it will happen if you just bend over for everything Jarrett does!&quot;

//&quot;I should have known better than give Saul a second chance,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;It&#39;s clear he doesn&#39;t want to play smart. It&#39;s time for me to double down on plans that DO work!&quot;//

$c[**Chalpe**]

Denine is sitting in the shelter, next to Louie, who is lying down.

&quot;I do want to go around and put together a strong social game,&quot; says Denine, &quot;but at the same time... I kind of don&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Not with these people,&quot; Louie agrees.

&quot;Exactly.&quot; Denine shakes her head. &quot;I mean, Rhett&#39;s okay, but in small doses.&quot;

&quot;Kid&#39;s got a screw loose,&quot; Louie adds. &quot;And the more you talk to him, the more you&#39;re unscrewing it.&quot;

&quot;And the others I feel are just hungry for validation or something,&quot; says Denine.

&quot;Why do you think I&#39;m not giving them any?&quot; Louie smirks.

The pair is interrupted by the arrival of Lisa, whom appears to be out of breath.

&quot;Denine, Louie, I regret to tell you both that Buddy is making his case to stay.&quot;

&quot;Oh no, he wants to win like the rest of us,&quot; says Louie. He pulls the brim of his cap over his eyes. &quot;How un-delightful.&quot;

&quot;So, what do you suggest we do?&quot; Denine asks.

&quot;I merely want to make sure the three of us and Jennifer will all vote Buddy the first time we lose,&quot; Lisa replies. &quot;Can we do that?&quot;

&quot;Do you even need to ask?&quot; Denine smiles.

&quot;I supposed that I might have to ask,&quot; says Lisa. &quot;I saw Buddy talking to Rhett, and with the utmost confidence I heard Rhett say he&#39;ll vote with him. He&#39;s close with Jennifer, one of us three is in serious danger.&quot;

//&quot;It is imperative I pull out all the stops.&quot; Lisa looks a little unsettled. &quot;I understand that our tribe has two pairs, myself, and Buddy. Up until today the choice has been easy, but I believe Buddy knows he is not in our good graces. I need to confirm with Jennifer and Denine that they are on my side... and to guarantee they do not get cold feet.&quot;//

After a bit more conversation, Lisa walks away. Jennifer seizes the opportunity and sneaks over to the shelter, before taking a seat next to Louie.

&quot;I&#39;ve been meaning to talk to you guys,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;Have you heard anything about what&#39;ll happen if we need to go vote?&quot;

&quot;Why are you suddenly so concerned about this?&quot; Louie asks.

&quot;Why are you not concerned?&quot; Jennifer replies. &quot;I&#39;m the tribe&#39;s leader, admittedly because I said so, and I&#39;d rather not have a communication meltdown. I don&#39;t know about you two, but I want to keep winning.&quot;

Denine nods. &quot;So do we. And if we don&#39;t, the way to guarantee we start winning again is to vote Buddy.&quot;

&quot;You haven&#39;t heard any other plans?&quot; Jennifer raises an eyebrow.

&quot;Nope,&quot; says Denine.

//&quot;What on Earth is everyone&#39;s problem today?&quot; Denine shrugs. &quot;Are you with me? Are you with me? No, I&#39;ve suddenly decided to align with the guy I hate the most. There are times to keep secrets, but this is a time to tell it like it is.&quot;//

&quot;So, what exactly are we doing again?&quot; Jennifer asks Rhett, near the end of the day. &quot;I feel like I&#39;m being taken for a ride.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; says Rhett.

&quot;That worries me.&quot;

//&quot;I&#39;m not confident about this anymore,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;Rhett is usually open with me, more so than anyone else. But now everyone is strangely insistent that I vote Buddy. I think the tides have turned, and people might be gunning for Louie. At least, I hope they aren&#39;t gunning for me...&quot;//

$q[**Quibas**]

Vaclav is sitting on a rock, deep in thought, while Khall hangs upside down on a tree branch above him.

&quot;I&#39;ve probably heard them tell the same stories over and over now,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;But every time I talk about plans, all I get back is &#39;vote Jackie, end of story&#39;. It&#39;s so frustrating.&quot;

&quot;Then maybe you shouldn&#39;t vote her,&quot; Khall replies.

&quot;What option do I have at this point? I&#39;ve committed to that trio. I don&#39;t know if I can trust Jackie, since she was perfectly willing to keep that dark sorceress.&quot; Vaclav narrows his eyes. &quot;If I vote out Paula, then Monty won&#39;t be happy. If I vote out Monty, then Paula won&#39;t be happy. If I vote out Jackie, then I&#39;m just confirming to them that I&#39;m their lap dog. I just can&#39;t win.&quot;

&quot;What if you vote me out?&quot; Khall asks.

&quot;Did... did you just say that?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s just a hypothetical question,&quot; says Khall. &quot;You don&#39;t have to if you don&#39;t want to.&quot;

&quot;Nobody else wants to vote you out,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;Then it would just be a waste. Aaaaargh! I don&#39;t know!!&quot;

//&quot;It&#39;s been a couple of days since we have had to do anything besides staying fed and energized,&quot; Khall explains. &quot;I think this is getting on Vaclav&#39;s nerves. He&#39;s been pretty agitated and restless.&quot;//

&quot;I can&#39;t think long-term in these cramped quarters. I just can&#39;t!&quot; Vaclav grabs his head and scratches at his dark brown hair. &quot;I feel like every second I spend out here is a second I&#39;m letting people plot against me.&quot;

&quot;Maybe you could just stop thinking that,&quot; says Khall.

&quot;Oh, thanks! I feel so much better!&quot; Vaclav says with a high-pitched voice.

Khall appears to smile underneath his hood, but it&#39;s always hard to tell. &quot;Any time, pal!&quot;

&quot;You didn&#39;t help me at all!&quot; Vaclav snaps.

//&quot;Everyone is too casual all the time,&quot; Vaclav mutters. &quot;It&#39;s getting on my nerves. Am I supposed to just take everyone&#39;s word on day 3 and clam up until we lose?&quot;//

&quot;We have five people, but three isn&#39;t even a majority anymore because of that twist!&quot; Vaclav continued. &quot;Our last vote was decided by someone Paula picked completely at random. How can I have confidence when we&#39;re split down the middle?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll vote with you,&quot; says Khall.

&quot;You&#39;ll vote out whoever I want?&quot; Vaclav asks, a bit surprised.

&quot;I, well, maybe not Jackie because we&#39;re allies and all.&quot; Khall sighs. &quot;You&#39;re right, this IS hard.&quot;

Monty then arrives at the tree and crosses his arms. &quot;You two boys playing nice?&quot; he asks. &quot;I heard yellin&#39;.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re good,&quot; says Khall. &quot;Except for Vaclav having a meltdown because he doesn&#39;t trust that a social bond can translate into an alliance.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s more complicated than that,&quot; says Vaclav.

&quot;I know, but do you think Monty wants to have that conversation with you?&quot; Khall replies.

&quot;V, you have my word that I will vote out Jackie,&quot; says Monty.

&quot;Why, because you don&#39;t like Jackie?&quot; Vaclav asks. &quot;Or is it because you need me to make merge so that I&#39;m seen as a bigger physical threat than you because of my age?&quot;

&quot;I would never treat you like that,&quot; says Monty. &quot;I&#39;ll vote Jackie because I like you. You&#39;re a good kid.&quot;

//&quot;I&#39;m an honest guy, I don&#39;t play games with people,&quot; says Monty. &quot;I don&#39;t want Vaddy to think I&#39;m like that. I&#39;d like to calm his nerves some to show I&#39;m with him.&quot; He spits.//

Just then, Khall falls out of the tree branch.

&quot;Oh, lordy,&quot; says Monty.

Vaclav looks around and starts calling for a medic.

&quot;I came here as fast as I can!&quot; comes a familiar voice almost immediately.

Vaclav and Monty turn around and stare dumbfounded when they see Khall, wearing a head mirror and a stethoscope. &quot;Who&#39;s injured?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d have to say common sense,&quot; says Monty, as Vaclav looks back to where Khall had fallen and sees nobody there.

//&quot;How did I do that? What do you mean, how did I do that?&quot; Khall crosses his arms. &quot;Look. Don&#39;t you have more important things to be discussing right about now?&quot;//

Immunity Challenge**

The challenge is a traditional King of the Hill challenge - each contestant will face off against one member of each opposing tribe, trying to knock each other off a circular, 3-meter-wide platform with sandbags. First to fall off in a round loses a point for their tribe, while the last one standing gains a point.
The tribe with the highest score will win two baskets of baked goods and immunity, the second-place tribe will win one basket and immunity, and the third-place tribe will get nothing but a visit to tribal council.

$c[Chalpe] has one extra member, and $c[Louie] volunteers to sit out.

&#39;&#39;Round One&#39;&#39;
$c[Denine] vs $o[Jarrett] vs $q[Monty]

Denine curses her team for not putting someone stronger in the lineup first. Jarrett rushes her and pushes her off.
Monty attempts to hold his ground, but when he misses a big swing, Jarrett capitalizes on it and pushes Monty off the platform.

$q[Quibas 0]

&#39;&#39;Round Two&#39;&#39;
$c[Buddy] vs $o[Rocky] vs $q[Paula]

Buddy and Paula exchange a knowing glance, before heading to double team Rocky. However, Rocky had already begun charging towards Paula, knocking her off with ease. He struggles with Buddy but eventually pushes him off as well. Rocky hoists his sandbag over his head and lets out a yell of triumph.

$c[Chalpe -1]

$q[Quibas -1]

&#39;&#39;Round Three&#39;&#39;
$c[Jennifer] vs $o[Saul] vs $q[Vaclav]

Jennifer and Vaclav rush each other and attempt to ram each other. It doesn&#39;t work, and leaves an opening for Saul to jump in.
Jennifer pivots to send Vaclav off-balance, turning her attention towards Saul. She knocks him off.
When Vaclav recovers, he runs towards Jennifer and charges her off the platform.

Louie is fast asleep while sitting upright next to Vincent.

$v[&quot;Great to see your enthusiasm,&quot;] Vincent remarks when Louie begins to snore.

&#39;&#39;Round Four&#39;&#39;
$c[Lisa] vs $o[Candace] vs $q[Jackie]

Jackie attempts to talk trash, but Candace admonishes her.
Lisa scrambles to knock off Jackie first, and after a brief struggle she succeeds.
Candace easily overpowers Lisa and sends her off as well.

$c[Chalpe -1]
$o[Ochora +2]
$q[Quibas -1]

$v[&quot;Congratulations Ochora, you are now guaranteed immunity and the first-place reward,&quot; says Vincent. &quot;Chalpe and Quibas, this round will determine whether you have to go to tribal council tonight.&quot;] 

&#39;&#39;Round Five&#39;&#39;
$c[Rhett] vs $o[Ashleia] vs $q[Khall]

Ashleia, who is secretly relieved that she is immune no matter what, finds it too difficult to fend off an attack from Rhett, and is the first to fall off the platform.
Rhett runs over to Khall, but when the two clash, neither one has much of an advantage.
Rhett takes a risk by shoving Khall back to the edge, and then throwing his sandbag. However, Khall jumps into the air, leaping off Rhett&#39;s sandbag while it&#39;s in mid-air, and smacks Rhett down with his own sandbag. With no sandbag to counter with, Rhett is nearly helpless to Khall pushing him off the platform.

$c[Chalpe -1]
$o[Ochora +1]
$q[Quibas 0]

$o[Ochora wins immunity and two baskets of baked goods!]
$q[Quibas wins immunity and one basket of baked goods!]
$c[Chalpe loses, and will have to vote out someone at tribal council.]

Chalpe is instructed to pick someone from Ochora to kidnap. Paula gives Buddy a hand signal, and Buddy chooses Rocky. Rocky expresses annoyance that he won&#39;t get first pick of his tribe&#39;s reward but goes with Chalpe.

$c[**Chalpe**]

Shortly after Chalpe returns to their camp, Buddy and Lisa excuse themselves for different reasons. Buddy meets up with Paula on the path to the Town Square.

&quot;Well, that could have gone better,&quot; says Paula. &quot;I thought we were lucky with the ordering.&quot;

&quot;Maybe it was for the best. No reason to raise suspicion for an early challenge like this,&quot; Buddy replies.

&quot;Normally I&#39;d agree, but you&#39;re already on the outs and it&#39;s only day nine,&quot; says Paula. &quot;This is when the stragglers get picked off. Right now, you&#39;re a straggler.&quot;

&quot;I have a plan,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;It&#39;s going to be a close one, but I&#39;m this close to flipping the tribe around. You know I won&#39;t give up if it&#39;s for a good cause.&quot;

&quot;Well I&#39;ve been setting up the groundwork for you to swing Saul onto our side,&quot; says Paula. &quot;I really hope you know what you&#39;re doing by picking Rocky instead.&quot;

//&quot;Buddy can be really cold and stubborn, even with me,&quot; says Paula. &quot;I don&#39;t know what he should do, but I only know what he tells me. When it comes to making a good decision, my hands are kind of tied.&quot;//

Back at the tribe camp, Lisa has returned, and appears to be upset about something.

&quot;I really hope we make the right decision tonight,&quot; says Lisa. &quot;I-it&#39;s the only way things can get better.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, we&#39;re voting him out,&quot; says Denine flatly. &quot;Relax, Lisa.&quot;

&quot;I believe you, I just...&quot; Lisa sniffles, and wipes her eyes. &quot;I&#39;ll tell you later.&quot;

//&quot;It&#39;s now or never,&quot; says Lisa. &quot;It&#39;s time for me to speak up and put this queasiness in my heart to rest. I know I can get through the night if the tribe hears my story.&quot;//

&quot;Nice flop at the challenge, by the way,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;Not earning a single point between the lot of you, it takes some coordination to be that pathetic.&quot;

&quot;It takes some nerve for that to be your first impression,&quot; says Jennifer.

&quot;I thought your first impression of me was the challenge I just won,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;You know, where I knocked Buddy off the platform and he still picked me to come here.&quot;

&quot;Well that&#39;s because he sucks,&quot; Denine replies.

&quot;Says the number one reason you guys lost!&quot; Rocky smirks. &quot;You fell first, without your help these guys would just be mediocre.&quot;

//&quot;For a bunch of suddenly humbled losers, this tribe has their fair share of egos,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;So, while I&#39;m here and untouchable, I might as well just rub their noses in the loss.&quot; He shrugs, with his palms facing upwards. &quot;What are they going to do, un-kidnap me?&quot;//

Buddy arrives at camp quietly, and Lisa winces.

&quot;What&#39;s her problem?&quot; Buddy asks.

Louie looks over at Lisa. &quot;I think she had something to say about you.&quot;

&quot;Care to just come clean while we&#39;re here?&quot; Jennifer folds her arms. &quot;We&#39;re not going into tribal council as a total mess.&quot;

&quot;What do I have to admit?&quot; Buddy replies. &quot;I haven&#39;t seen her since the challenge.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t blame you,&quot; says Rocky, &quot;but alas, you&#39;re in this sinking boat with them.&quot;

&quot;Shut up, Rocky, the adults are talking,&quot; says Jennifer.

//&quot;Lisa&#39;s worked up about something. Buddy&#39;s been weirdly aggressive towards her recently.&quot; Jennifer shakes her head. &quot;So much for my Louie-blindside theory. It&#39;s my responsibility as the tribe peace-maker to figure out what&#39;s happening, and it&#39;s frustrating when nobody wants to cooperate.&quot;//

&quot;Buddy, you haven&#39;t done anything to Lisa, have you?&quot; Rhett asks.

&quot;No,&quot; says Buddy.

&quot;Well that settles that,&quot; says Rhett.

&quot;You&#39;re going to believe him that quickly?&quot; Denine asks.

&quot;Do you even know what you&#39;re accusing of?&quot; Rhett snaps. He points directly at Denine. &quot;I cannot stand for baseless attempts to assassinate someone&#39;s character like this. We have rights as citizens, and I&#39;ll be damned if anyone tries to take my freedom away!&quot;

//&quot;I have lost so much respect for Denine,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;She has dubious intentions, I am certain of it. I understood the reasoning for voting Buddy out, but this is overkill. What is she trying to prove by doing this?&quot;//

&quot;Please, Lisa, don&#39;t allow yourself to be silenced by anyone,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;Speak freely! We will pass no judgment.&quot;

&quot;I... I don&#39;t know if I can tell you if he&#39;s here,&quot; says Lisa.

Buddy pretends to cough, sandwiching &quot;Bullshit!&quot; in between coughs.

&quot;Buddy, stop!&quot; Denine yells.

&quot;No, Rhett&#39;s right! I&#39;m not going to take... whatever this is!&quot; Buddy yells back. &quot;I can&#39;t deal with your nonsense tonight, so if you would kindly let someone else have their say, that would be great.&quot;

&quot;Quit being a prick,&quot; Denine snaps. &quot;Not everything is about you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m still waiting...&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t take this anymore,&quot; Lisa cries out. &quot;Stop!&quot;

&quot;Then stop lying to us,&quot; Buddy replies.

&quot;You&#39;re ALL guilty of hiding secrets!&quot; Rhett snaps.

Jennifer steps into the middle of the group. &quot;This is going nowhere but down!&quot; she interjects. &quot;This is not how a successful tribe operates. We don&#39;t have to all be friends, but we cannot all collapse after losing one measly challenge.&quot;

&quot;Right. Well, I&#39;ve made up my mind. I&#39;m going for a swim.&quot; Louie gets up and walks around to the back of the shelter, out of sight.

&quot;Here&#39;s the deal,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;You all have your problems, that&#39;s obvious. But I don&#39;t care! In fact, I rather enjoy seeing you fight. But I don&#39;t want to look like a moron tonight, so maybe spend less time crying because you all can&#39;t make friends, and start talking about what I can do to make you guys a little less pathetic.&quot;

&quot;I was kind of getting to that,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;And we really don&#39;t care much for the commentary.&quot;

&quot;I think it&#39;s fitting,&quot; says Buddy.

&quot;So how about this. Buddy, you can waste your vote however you&#39;d like,&quot; says Denine. &quot;But we have five votes on you. Choose carefully, Rocky, do you want to go for the path of least resistance? Or be a complete pariah because you&#39;re too cool to make rational decisions?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be so sure,&quot; says Rhett. He looks over at Buddy. &quot;You wanted an ally? Now you&#39;ve got one.&quot;

Denine and Lisa&#39;s eyes go wide.

&quot;Rhett, why are you covering for him? You will only make things worse,&quot; Lisa pleads. &quot;He&#39;s not a gentleman like you are, don&#39;t let him manipulate you.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t listen to her, Rhett, she&#39;s the fakest person you&#39;ll ever meet,&quot; says Buddy quickly.

&quot;I am an adult who can make my own choices, thank you very much.&quot; Rhett stares down both Buddy and Lisa into silence.

&quot;And the choice presents itself,&quot; says Rocky with a smirk. &quot;Thanks for being so easy to read.&quot;

&quot;I guess we should let the cards fall where they may.&quot; Jennifer shakes her head. &quot;But tonight, I need an explanation... from all of you... before I can vote.&quot;

$v[**Tribal Council**]

The Chalpe Tribe, with Rocky, walks into the tribal council building. Buddy and Rocky place their ignited torches behind the seven seats around the fire, while the other five are given the fire-is-life spiel by Vincent. The group them sits down around the fire, with Rocky in the middle.

$v[&quot;Lisa, your tribe went from first to second to last. Did you expect to be sitting here a few days ago?&quot;]

Lisa lowers her head. &quot;I guess I... I might have desired to be here earlier, because there is something I simply cannot keep running from.&quot;

&quot;Oh, here we go,&quot; says Buddy.

&quot;I just want something to change,&quot; says Lisa. &quot;This tribe... I&#39;ve been violated here in all kinds of ways. All I want to do is do what it takes to move past this.&quot;

&quot;Violated?&quot; Louie looks shocked, but not too interested.

&quot;Is this what you were afraid to tell us?&quot; Jennifer asks.

Lisa nods solemnly. &quot;I thought... I thought maybe this is a safe place, and I could tell you guys now...&quot;

&quot;What did he do?&quot; Denine asks, completely sympathetic to Lisa&#39;s plight.

&quot;Well, today... when we were alone after the challenge, he-&quot; Lisa begins.

&quot;You dishonest little bitch,&quot; says Buddy.

$v[&quot;Rhett, help me out here, what are they talking about?&quot;]

&quot;When we got back, Lisa started crying over something,&quot; Rhett explains, &quot;but she didn&#39;t want to tell us what it was.&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t want to?&quot; Denine interjects.

&quot;Rhett, why?!&quot; Lisa nearly bawls. &quot;I have been weighed down by this for too long; I am horrified that you want to turn a blind eye like this.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m simply having a more critical eye,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;Jennifer said she wanted an explanation, and she&#39;s not the only one who&#39;s interested in finding the real truth behind this sort of thing.&quot;

&quot;When did this last happen? Just after the challenge, when the two of you weren&#39;t there?&quot; Jennifer asks.

Lisa solemnly nods.

&quot;I didn&#39;t even see her,&quot; says Buddy.

&quot;You had your turn,&quot; says Louie.

&quot;So did Denine,&quot; Buddy snaps, &quot;but you let her keep going because she&#39;s the only one who puts up with you.&quot;

&quot;Come on, this is tribal council,&quot; says Rocky, &quot;not a //trial// council.&quot;

$v[&quot;Rocky, as someone not on this tribe looking in... was that supposed to be a joke?&quot;]

&quot;I&#39;m sure you already know he&#39;s a dumbass,&quot; says Jennifer.

$v[&quot;Denine, do you know where all this bad blood is coming from?&quot;]

Denine nonchalantly points at Buddy.

&quot;Real mature,&quot; Buddy says quickly and in monotone.

&quot;It&#39;s true, though,&quot; says Denine.

&quot;Get bent.&quot;

&quot;Come on, guys! I don&#39;t want to be here all night. Lisa, how can we help?&quot; Jennifer asks.

&quot;Just do what we all agreed on and vote Buddy out,&quot; says Lisa. &quot;It would at least give me some closure.&quot;

&quot;Until Rhett starts touching you at night, I suppose,&quot; says Buddy.

&quot;What is THAT supposed to mean!?&quot; Rhett yells. &quot;I would never disrespect a lady like that!&quot;

&quot;Exactly, but if Lisa says it then it must be true!&quot; Buddy exclaims. &quot;She&#39;s putting on a front because if you all vote me out, then that leaves Denine and Louie as a pair, Rhett and Jennifer as a pair, and she&#39;s sitting in the middle.&quot;

$v[&quot;So you think you&#39;re being framed so Lisa can get farther in the game?&quot;]

&quot;Why else would she do this? Half the tribe doesn&#39;t like me,&quot; says Buddy, &quot;and she supposedly has enough votes against me already. She wants to look like a victim instead of a capable player.&quot;

Denine looks disgusted, and opens her mouth to make a rebuttal, but says nothing.

&quot;That makes no sense,&quot; says Lisa. &quot;Why would I be dishonest if you are on the way out?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re setting up the long game,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;If you&#39;re in the middle then everyone will need you, and suddenly you have four firm allies going into the swap.&quot;

&quot;Why should we not listen to her over someone who continuously insults us to our faces?&quot; Louie counters.

&quot;Then you&#39;re simply asking to be taken advantage of,&quot; Buddy replies. &quot;Sometimes, you have to side with people you don&#39;t like. Get over it.&quot;

$v[&quot;Louie, do you think there is truth to what Buddy is saying, or is this a last ditch attempt to save himself?&quot;]

&quot;Whatever truth is not worth hearing it from him,&quot; says Louie.

&quot;That is not the kind of attitude we should be having,&quot; Rhett counters. &quot;Do you want to be a sheep to whatever the loudest and most powerful voices demand of you?&quot;

&quot;I hate these implications, Rhett...&quot; Lisa buries her face in her hands.

&quot;Well, this is going nowhere fast,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;Can we vote now?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not done yet,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;Buddy, it&#39;s easy to deny her, but you need an alibi. What were you doing when Lisa claims you were sexually assaulting her?&quot;

&quot;Oh, is this really what this is about!?&quot; Buddy snaps. &quot;You think I would sexually assault her? Nothing she&#39;s said tonight is the truth.&quot;

&quot;ANSWER THE DAMN QUESTION,&quot; Jennifer roars.

&quot;You want to hear the truth? Here&#39;s some truth for you,&quot; Buddy snaps. &quot;I would never do something like that to Lisa, even if she is a silicone Barbie bitch, and I have a great reason for it!&quot;

$v[&quot;Buddy, pipe down, you&#39;re not being interrupted.&quot;]

Buddy takes a deep breath. &quot;I. Am. Gay.&quot;

Nobody on the tribe visibly reacts, except for Lisa, whose jaw drops.

&quot;Hell, I&#39;ll believe it,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;You can hear it in his voice.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?!&quot; Buddy, Denine, and Jennifer ask loudly and in unison.

Rocky rolls his eyes. &quot;Who cares? I&#39;m covering for you.&quot;

Buddy clears his throat. &quot;Well, if you want to hear some more truth... Lisa. You talked about your dad. You know, the one who died right before you flew out here? What was his name?&quot;

Lisa looks totally stunned by this question. &quot;What? But he- I-&quot;

&quot;You did tell us about him,&quot; says Louie.

&quot;Come on, Lisa, surely you know what your own dad&#39;s name was,&quot; says Buddy, completely seriously.

&quot;He&#39;s not dead, you asshole!&quot; Lisa shrieks.

&quot;You said you never got to say goodbye to him!&quot;

&quot;He was stuck in traffic! It was a poor choice of words!&quot;

&quot;Or was it a woe-is-me strategic lie!? Or maybe you&#39;re lying right now!&quot;

&quot;**SHUT UP!**&quot; Jennifer screams, jumping out of her seat. &quot;I&#39;ve heard ENOUGH out of you two, and surely everyone else has too! Has anyone here NOT made up their minds? Because I want to vote, get this over with, and go to bed!&quot;

Everyone looks at Jennifer in shock, horror, or confusion.

$v[&quot;I&#39;ll take that as a no. Rocky, do you want to give up immunity?&quot;]

&quot;It would be kind of funny, after all this, if I wanted to save Buddy or Lisa,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;But nah, it&#39;s not worth it.&quot;

$v[&quot;Then it&#39;s time to vote. Louie, you are up first.&quot;]

&quot;Neither of them have idols,&quot; Louie whispers to Denine before getting up and going to vote.

...

Lisa reveals her vote to be for **Buddy**. &quot;Obnoxious piece of shit, I never want to see you again.&quot;

Buddy reveals his vote to be for **Lisa**. &quot;You can sit and spin, you little &#96;c**t&#96;.&quot;

Lisa shakes her head, but Rhett says, &quot;you should have seen that coming.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$v[&quot;Lisa. She leads with three.&quot;]

Lisa&#39;s face turns from one of sorrow to one of rage.

&quot;Oh my god...&quot; Jennifer places her forehead in her right palm, leaning forward onto her arm.

$v[&quot;Third $boot is Lisa. You need to bring me your torch.&quot;]

&quot;Fuck you all,&quot; says Lisa. She gets up. &quot;My dad is still alive.&quot;

&quot;Oh, Buddy was lying about that? Let me go and change my vote,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;Oh wait.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s still next,&quot; says Denine.

&quot;I don&#39;t care, Denine!&quot; Lisa snaps. &quot;You and Louie are the useless loads on this team, anyways!&quot; She speed-walks to get her torch.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry for doubting you, Buddy,&quot; says Jennifer.

&quot;Thanks, Jen,&quot; Buddy replies. &quot;And thank you, too, Rhett.&quot;

&quot;No problem,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;But you should know that I like girls.&quot;

Lisa walks by the three, her torch (possibly intentionally) whacking Rhett in the head. She plants it in front of Vincent.

$v[&quot;Lisa, the tribe has spoken.&quot;] Vincent extinguishes the blonde woman&#39;s torch. $v[&quot;Time for you to go.&quot;]

&quot;So stupid...&quot; Lisa mutters under her breath as she walks out.

$v[&quot;Tonight was a spectacle from start to finish,&quot;] says Vincent. $v[&quot;I&#39;m still trying to process what just happened there, but from the looks of it, you did your best to put an issue to rest. Lisa&#39;s argument wasn&#39;t good enough for her to stay. Let&#39;s hope that the future doesn&#39;t hold more of the same for you. You can head back to camp.&quot;]
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$c[//&quot;I didn&#39;t do anything wrong, I just got stuck with a group of good-for-nothing dumbasses,&quot; says Lisa. &quot;No, I don&#39;t think I could have kept up the act for 39 days, but to have it all unraveled because of a TRAFFIC JAM? I&#39;d ask for a do-over, but I&#39;d rather forget I was ever here.&quot; She buries her face in her hands. &quot;I could really cry, but I&#39;m out of tears.&quot;//]

(replace: &quot;votenum&quot;)[five](replace: &quot;votedpeople&quot;)[Chalpe plus Rocky]
&quot;Not bad,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;You guys put on quite a show there.&quot;

The Chalpe tribe collectively groans.

&quot;Why do you have to act so high and mighty?&quot; Jennifer asks indignantly. &quot;You&#39;re not better than us just because you guys won the last challenge. Considering you guys lost someone as well-&quot;

&quot;Oh, please, like Buddy wasn&#39;t doing the same thing in the first round,&quot; says Rocky.

&quot;I wasn&#39;t,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;I was the deciding vote, but I didn&#39;t rub that in their faces, I was too busy playing the game.&quot;

Rocky scoffs. &quot;Do you guys not know how to have fun or something?&quot;

&quot;Fun!? We&#39;re surviving on two bowls of rice a day, if that,&quot; Jennifer snaps. &quot;I&#39;m hungry, I&#39;m tired, I&#39;m sick of this endless bickering between you three –&quot; she points to Denine, Louie, and Buddy, &quot;– and the last thing I want to do is throw a party.&quot;

//&quot;I&#39;m up for a good time when a good time can be had,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;But now is not the time and not the place, and this is definitely not the kind of crowd I&#39;d want to hang with. Especially not with Rocky in the peanut gallery.&quot;//

&quot;Relax, Jennifer,&quot; says Louie. &quot;We all voted together, the right person left, let&#39;s not get so uptight over nothing.&quot;

&quot;The right person left?&quot; Buddy raises an eyebrow. &quot;That&#39;s funny. Based on what you were saying before, that&#39;s not what I thought you&#39;d say.&quot;

&quot;Her torch is snuffed, that&#39;s what matters,&quot; says Louie.

&quot;Then why did you want to keep her so badly?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t really, her attitude was grating,&quot; Louie admits.

&quot;She just crossed a line at tribal with her lying about you,&quot; Denine adds. &quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong, you&#39;re still a stubborn, loud-mouthed dick and I hate you.&quot;

&quot;The feeling&#39;s mutual,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;Just grow up.&quot;

//&quot;Seeing that Denine and Louie are continuing to be horrible even after saving me,&quot; says Buddy, &quot;I have to think they didn&#39;t do it out of the goodness of their hearts. I&#39;m definitely going to need to make sure Rhett and Jennifer come on my side now.&quot;//

$o[**Ochora**]

The four members of the tribe that are present are enjoying the baked goods they won as a reward.

&quot;I&#39;m really glad we got a win for once,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;Like, I think it just shows that we are capable and can put up a fight.&quot;

&quot;The only problem is that it was an individual challenge,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;The other sides have us beat when it comes to teamwork.&quot;

&quot;Can you blame us? I mean, look at who we&#39;ve had to deal with,&quot; says Candace. &quot;Rocky&#39;s self-centered and would gladly screw us out of first if it means someone he hates gets last. And since he got a point, he&#39;s going to gloat about it the second he gets back. As well, some leader Min-Ji turned out to be.&quot;

Saul glares at Candace. &quot;She is not here to defend herself. Please, no need to drag her name through the mud.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just making an observation,&quot; says Candace.

&quot;She hardly had a chance to seek forgiveness,&quot; Saul replies.

&quot;It was a hard choice to make, Saul.&quot; Candace shakes her head. &quot;But what&#39;s done is done.&quot;

//&quot;Saul has got to let go of the past,&quot; says Candace. &quot;Yeah, we could have voted out Rocky, but we didn&#39;t. You can&#39;t always vote based on the purity of one&#39;s soul. I&#39;m not here to find my inner Zen, I&#39;m here to make bank.&quot;//

&quot;Hey, if I wanted to be in the middle of pointless bickering with a mouthful of semi-stale bread,&quot; Jarrett snaps, &quot;I could host a family gathering. The guy we&#39;re all tired of listening to, he isn&#39;t even here right now.&quot;

&quot;I think I&#39;ve lost my appetite,&quot; says Ashleia.

&quot;How could you have?&quot; Jarrett asks. &quot;You&#39;ve had no more than three loaves.&quot;

&quot;I still have to watch my figure,&quot; Ashleia replies. &quot;And, like, I gotta go easy on the carbs. We&#39;re short on protein sources as is.&quot;

Candace and Jarrett share a confused expression.

&quot;Out here, you will certainly burn it off,&quot; says Saul.

&quot;Maybe later, when there&#39;s less drama about Min-Ji happening.&quot; Ashleia gets up and walks over to tend to the fire.

//&quot;Having someone like Rocky on our tribe is really getting to the others,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;I know they don&#39;t mean to be all wound up, but they need to be able to deal with it. If they can&#39;t keep their composure when nobody wants them out, I&#39;m worried about what will happen later on.&quot;//

&quot;Okay everyone quiet for a minute,&quot; Saul says quickly. He closes his eyes, folds his hands, and hums very softly.

Jarrett leans over to Candace and whispers, &quot;Have you seen him concentrate this hard on something before?&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t say that I have,&quot; Candace replies in a similar whisper. &quot;But I do sense a lot of anxiety.&quot;

Jarrett continues to wait until Saul is done, while Candace takes the opportunity to glance into one of the baked good baskets and quietly pull out a slip of paper.

//&quot;So, Saul was trying extra hard to block everything out and focus on one of his visions, since someone usually interrupts him,&quot; says Candace. &quot;It was perfect, because the ambient noise gave me the perfect cover to snag this.&quot; She holds up a small piece of slightly yellowed paper. &quot;This is going to get me right to the idol, and I bet I can snag it before any of the guys can.&quot;//

Saul&#39;s eyes snap open, and the humming stops. &quot;Well I think that was the best I can get out here. But this is really important.&quot;

&quot;For our tribe?&quot; Jarrett asks. &quot;If it&#39;s going to help our tribe you should definitely tell us what you saw.&quot;

Saul nods. &quot;I saw this tribe... all five of us were on a boat. A storm came in, and we started to sink. There were two more ships that we called out to for help.&quot;

&quot;The other tribes,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;Is that all?&quot;

&quot;Candace threw something overboard,&quot; says Saul. &quot;Then a big wave came and lifted our boat into the air, and both of the other ships crashed into rocks.&quot;

&quot;Was there anything special about the rocks? Were there names on there, were they special colours, anything like that?&quot;

Saul shakes his head. &quot;They were just rocks.&quot;

&quot;Did you notice anything about the other sailors?&quot; Jarrett asks.

&quot;They were too far away, sadly.&quot;

&quot;Come on, Jarrett,&quot; says Candace, &quot;it was a prophetic vision, not a political cartoon.&quot;

//&quot;I don&#39;t know exactly how truthful Saul&#39;s visions are,&quot; Jarrett admits, &quot;but the guy has wings, so I&#39;m not going to push my luck. All I know is that while he&#39;s with us, he could be a good source of information to help our tribe later down the road.&quot;//

//&quot;Jarrett thinks he can use me and get away with it,&quot; says Saul. &quot;If I could divine everything whenever I wanted, I would not need this competition. It is clear to me now that it is Candace who holds the key to our success, not Jarrett, and when the time comes, I will make that clear.&quot;//

$q[**Quibas**]

Vaclav has gathered the rest of the tribe, and he is standing on the other side of the fire from his four tribemates.

&quot;Alright, welcome to your second tribal council,&quot; says Vaclav.

&quot;This is ridiculous,&quot; says Jackie.

&quot;But we haven&#39;t lit our torches yet,&quot; says Khall. He gets up. &quot;I&#39;m going to go get them so we-&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s quite alright, Khall,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;Nobody is actually getting voted off. I just... I want to figure out what the problem is.&quot;

&quot;The problem with what?&quot; Monty asks.

&quot;With our tribe, with us,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;We&#39;ve all been kind of tense recently. I don&#39;t want to be headed for a fall, I want to be able to work out our differences.&quot;

&quot;So you put us all in the same space and ask leading questions?&quot; Paula asks. &quot;I know you mean well, but I don&#39;t think this will help.&quot;

//&quot;I&#39;m not doing it for them,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;I&#39;m doing it to calm my own nerves because I am SERIOUSLY flipping out here. Everyone here is smiling to your face but talking down behind your back, and I don&#39;t work well with that.&quot;//

&quot;Just give me a chance,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;Okay. Jackie, you wanted to vote Monty out last time and you didn&#39;t get your way. What did you have against him, and how are you going to address that?&quot;

&quot;I was just voting with my alliance,&quot; says Jackie, &quot;and I&#39;ll address it by continuing to have an alliance. Is that what you wanted to hear?&quot;

&quot;Alliance schmalliance,&quot; Vaclav snaps. &quot;That does not explain why you two don&#39;t give each other the time of day.&quot;

&quot;Because I know where my priorities lie,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;And it&#39;s not with people like him.&quot;

&quot;I have been nothing but humble and grateful towards all of you,&quot; says Monty. &quot;The fact that Jackie continues to hold some sort of vendetta is really upsetting. I don&#39;t raise my kids to be petty and hold grudges like that.&quot;

Jackie runs her fingers through her hair. &quot;Your kids would be terrible at Survivor then.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s no reason to bring his kids into this, Jackie!&quot; Paula exclaims. &quot;You can&#39;t admit that you have any faults, or that anyone connected to you does.&quot;

&quot;Not true,&quot; Khall protests, &quot;she will readily admit that I have faults!&quot;

&quot;And being a bad ally is NOT one of them,&quot; says Jackie, &quot;which is more than I can say for you.&quot;

&quot;You seriously think that chattering about endgame deals on day one makes us allies?&quot; Paula&#39;s eyes go wide. &quot;Do you not know how to read people?&quot;

&quot;I do, I just didn&#39;t think you would screw up the way you did,&quot; Jackie replies.

//&quot;Paula can go off all she wants,&quot; says Jackie, &quot;but at the end of the day, she&#39;s the one who got her way. She stabbed me in the back and acts like it&#39;s MY fault. Are you kidding me?&quot;//

&quot;Monty, do you know what might be making Jackie this frustrated?&quot; Vaclav asks.

&quot;Hell if I know,&quot; Monty replies. He spits onto the ground beside him.

&quot;What kind of question is that, Vaclav?&quot; Jackie asks indignantly. &quot;He knows DAMN well why I don&#39;t like him!&quot;

&quot;Yeah Monty, how dare you not have washboard abs,&quot; says Paula flatly.

&quot;You think Jackie is just being vain?&quot; Khall asks.

&quot;I can&#39;t think of any good reason,&quot; says Paula.

Jackie opens her mouth to respond.

&quot;A GOOD reason,&quot; Monty adds.

Vaclav throws his arms up. &quot;Is this seriously what we&#39;ve become, now?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re surprised?&quot; Paula asks. &quot;We all knew this wasn&#39;t going to end well. And I don&#39;t want to even look at Jackie anymore. Later.&quot; She walks off, headed to Town Square.

//&quot;I need time to think,&quot; says Paula. &quot;I don&#39;t cope well in spaces where nobody has a filter. This is usually where I have another one of my friends step in, but I can&#39;t fight people like Buddy can without wanting to break down.&quot; She wipes her right eye with her hand.//

&quot;Why do I even bother...&quot; Vaclav turns away and walks off in another direction, head down.

&quot;If we don&#39;t win again, he&#39;s going to be in for a rough night,&quot; says Monty.

&quot;Not to worry, because we are going to win,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;Sucking is not an option.&quot;

&quot;It ain&#39;t good to be cocky,&quot; says Monty.

&quot;I mean, if we lose it won&#39;t be because of me, is all I&#39;m saying.&quot;

//&quot;Where I&#39;m from, if you do somebody wrong, you &#39;fess up,&quot; says Monty. &quot;No good to keep people pissed. But I ain&#39;t see myself do nothing wrong. Jackie got problems, man.&quot;//

$c[**Chalpe**]

&quot;At least we were on the same page.&quot;

Denine is inspecting her hands, letting the fact that her nails will be dirty as long as she&#39;s competing sink in. Louie is lying on his back, watching the clouds.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Louie asks.

&quot;Last night,&quot; says Denine. &quot;We had each other&#39;s backs. And I imagine that last-minute whisper about the idols was your way of saying &#39;just get Lisa out&#39;.&quot;

&quot;There was no use fighting it,&quot; Louie replies. &quot;They were dead set on her. It&#39;s not like we had any sympathy towards her.&quot;

&quot;How did you know?&quot; Denine asks.

&quot;Remember when I said I was going to go swimming?&quot; Louie smirks. &quot;I didn&#39;t, I went through her bag. And Buddy&#39;s... and Jennifer&#39;s... and Rhett&#39;s. All clear for now.&quot;

&quot;For now?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll check again tonight probably.&quot;

//&quot;I checked Denine&#39;s too, just to be safe,&quot; says Louie. &quot;Why wouldn&#39;t I? She&#39;s keeping me safe, but you can never be sure when that will change. I want to be ready if she ever gets any funny ideas.&quot;//

&quot;Well, at least we&#39;re safe for now, but we can&#39;t really be sure what the other three are up to,&quot; Denine admits. &quot;Is this some kind of permanent arrangement they have now?&quot;

&quot;One vote can&#39;t really cancel out more than a week of a bad first impression,&quot; says Louie.

&quot;I&#39;m just unsure is all,&quot; says Denine. &quot;We&#39;ve got to keep our options open. No matter who left last night, that was our free pass. I&#39;m thinking if we might have to see if we can get Buddy on our side to-&quot;

&quot;Are you kidding me?&quot; Louie narrows his eyes. &quot;Wasn&#39;t all this going on because we never wanted to see him again?&quot;

&quot;Jennifer and Rhett are tight,&quot; says Denine. &quot;And I&#39;m sure the teams are going to be shaken up soon. We don&#39;t want to be caught with a bunch of strangers and someone with a grudge against us.&quot;

&quot;Well you can go do that,&quot; says Louie, &quot;and I&#39;ll stay here and do anything but that.&quot;

//&quot;I will not let anyone get under my skin,&quot; says Denine adamantly. &quot;I can be a force to be reckoned with, and I think my tribe underestimates me right now. I just need to keep my eye on the prize and not take things personally.&quot;//

$o[**Ochora**]

Ashleia and Saul and talking together by the treemail box.

&quot;I know what I want to do, but I don&#39;t really know where Jarrett&#39;s head is at,&quot; Ashleia explains. &quot;Like, when we voted out Min-Ji it was because she had hurt our tribe.&quot;

Saul looks slightly disappointed with Ashleia for that remark.

&quot;I&#39;m just saying,&quot; Ashleia protests. &quot;But if we do that again, the person who&#39;s hurting us the most is Rocky, right? But every time I tell Jarrett, he says &#39;maybe&#39;. Like, what can he be waiting for?&quot;

&quot;He could be playing it safe,&quot; says Saul. &quot;Rocky might have an idol. I do not have complete faith in Candace that she has prevented him from obtaining it.&quot;

&quot;I have more faith in Candace than I do in Jarrett,&quot; Ashleia confesses. &quot;I respect him, but guys like him who have it all together... there&#39;s often something wrong with them.&quot;

//&quot;I have a good instinct with whether people are actually nice or just out for themselves,&quot; says Ashleia, &quot;so I&#39;m a bit disappointed that maybe Jarrett is not as solid as I thought. There&#39;s only, like, so many times you can go back on a promise.&quot;//

&quot;Jarrett has something of a consistency about him,&quot; Saul replies. &quot;Candace has two personas, and they are in constant discord with each other. The thing I fear most is if they can both keep a secret from us.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s why I trust you more than anyone else here,&quot; says Ashleia.

&quot;Well, that is a pleasant surprise, I suppose...&quot; Saul blushes slightly.

&quot;It&#39;s true, though, the other people here are just subtly unreliable,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;I guess, kind of like that cute pair of shoes that go just with your outfit, but then you break them in and realize they aren&#39;t Prada, they&#39;re //Prodo//. Whether it&#39;s ten days or five hundred bucks, it&#39;s a bit of a waste.&quot;

&quot;Five hundred dollars is a &#39;bit of a waste&#39; to you?&quot;

&quot;Shoes are expensive!&quot; Ashleia protests.

Saul looks down at his feet. &quot;I got these for ten dollars.&quot;

//&quot;It has been a little while since the last alliance I got was lost,&quot; says Saul. &quot;I am hoping that my ties with Ashleia and Jarrett will be enough to keep me here, but considering Candace seems ready to work with Rocky now... I am hoping for a win.&quot;//

&quot;They sure look like ten-dollar shoes,&quot; came an all-too-familiar voice.

&quot;Hi, Rocky,&quot; says Ashleia as flatly as she can. &quot;We&#39;re just... talking...&quot;

&quot;Oh, I know, princess,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;You aren&#39;t discussing any kind of blindside plan, are you?&quot;

&quot;Neither of our priorities have been changed,&quot; says Saul.

&quot;You know, you&#39;re really bad at looking tough.&quot; Rocky chuckles. &quot;You can talk to me, but don&#39;t bother trying to intimidate me.&quot;

Saul gives Rocky a dirty look, but Rocky merely smirks.

&quot;Why can&#39;t you have a little respect?&quot; Ashleia asks, crossing her arms.

&quot;Oh, you have no IDEA what I could be doing to you guys right now,&quot; says Rocky.

Saul quickly steps backwards and to the side to physically close Rocky off from the conversation, while at the same time Rocky steps forward, intending to show off his rough claws.

Rocky accidentally drives his nails right near the top of Saul&#39;s wing, causing Saul to loudly growl in pain.

&quot;Ow, what the hell, Rocky?&quot;

Rocky&#39;s eyes go wide. &quot;I really didn&#39;t mean to do that, you just walked in the way and—&quot;

&quot;What were you even trying to do? Because it hurts like a bitch!&quot; Saul bites his lip. &quot;Congratulations, you left a mark. Get lost, go be an arrogant little punk somewhere else!&quot;

Rocky, completely stunned, quietly backs away.

//&quot;I think I got a little blood,&quot; says Rocky quietly. &quot;It doesn&#39;t feel good when you don&#39;t mean to hurt anyone.&quot;//

&quot;Do you need a medic?&quot; Ashleia asks.

&quot;Does the medic have whiskey?&quot; Saul groans.

&quot;Like, rubbing alcohol?&quot;

&quot;Ash, //please// tell me you&#39;re kidding.&quot;

$q[**Quibas**]

Vaclav is once again pacing back and forth, wringing his hands together.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe it... what on earth is wrong with me?&quot;

//&quot;Yesterday I tried to get everyone to sort out their differences,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;It backfired, and everyone was just yelling at each other. But there&#39;s a part of me that thinks it was a bit too explosive, like it was all rehearsed before. Like they expected me to do something like this.&quot;//

Somewhere else in camp, Paula is talking to Monty.

&quot;Have you seen Vaclav around? I kind of wanted to check in with him,&quot; says Paula.

Monty shakes his head. &quot;No clue, darlin&#39;. He&#39;s been in a stink since yesterday, I s&#39;pose.&quot;

&quot;I told him, I told him it was impossible to reason with the likes of Jackie,&quot; Paula adds. She shakes her head. &quot;They never listen.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s alright, we still got a chance to get through to him,&quot; says Monty.

&quot;Well, we&#39;re running out of time.&quot; Paula sighs. &quot;Who knows when we&#39;ll swap? I know we have each others&#39; backs, but can either of us trust him now?&quot;

//Vaclav takes a deep breath. &quot;Monty was really on edge. And Paula seemed to go on the offensive with Jackie. That&#39;s out of character, for both of them. I&#39;ve been with those two long enough to know it&#39;s not a coincidence. There must have been something that set them off that I&#39;m not seeing.&quot;//

&quot;Have you decided who we&#39;re going to vote yet?&quot; Khall asks.

&quot;For the hundredth time, no I have not,&quot; Jackie snaps.

&quot;It&#39;s only been 27 times,&quot; says Khall.

&quot;That&#39;s nice, but I wasn&#39;t counting. I didn&#39;t think I would need to,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;I think I have a plan though. Vaclav has been on his own for a while, and Paula and Monty are still together. After yesterday&#39;s incident, I think Vaclav is sick of them. He&#39;s seen their true colours.&quot;

&quot;So, we side with him to vote one of them out?&quot; Khall asks.

&quot;There&#39;s the sixth person who can mess things up for us,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;If Ochora wins, then no matter who we get will probably be someone we can work with. We made a deal with that tribe, remember?&quot;

&quot;But if we don&#39;t, then do we side with him and cause a tie?&quot;

&quot;No, we switch sides!&quot; Jackie clasps her hands together. &quot;That&#39;s the best part. We backstab Vaclav when he THINKS he&#39;s in the middle. And then it&#39;s just us two against them two, and we can beat either of them in a tie.&quot;

&quot;There won&#39;t be a tie,&quot; says Khall. &quot;We&#39;d kidnap someone, remember? And if we vote him out, if they side with Monty and Paula then one of us will get voted out.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s when you step in and take the bullet,&quot; says Jackie.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure I like this plan.&quot;

Jackie rolls her eyes. &quot;You just don&#39;t see the bigger picture.&quot;

//&quot;Khall is the one I&#39;m most worried about,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;He just doesn&#39;t understand things, and I don&#39;t want him to get tricked because he missed something important. Especially not if it means I get sent home over it. Hopefully Jackie can convince him to keep me in.&quot;//

Back at camp, Paula is sitting in the shelter alone when Jackie walks past.

&quot;We got treemail,&quot; says Jackie, &quot;and it&#39;s another challenge.&quot;

&quot;Think we can win this one?&quot; Paula asks.

&quot;That&#39;s up to you,&quot; Jackie replies.

&quot;Bitch.&quot; Paula mutters under her breath.

//&quot;For all I know, they&#39;ve already figured this out,&quot; says Vaclav, &quot;and are just leading me on until they stab me in the back. But I&#39;m not done yet, they&#39;ll see!&quot;//

**Immunity Challenge**

Each tribe has a board of nine tiles, that they will attempt to break with rocks. Two members from each tribe will need to collect bags of rocks and run them to a conveyer belt, where two more members will manually crank a conveyor belt to move the rocks to the thrower. The thrower will open the bags and attempt to break all nine tiles with the rocks inside. First tribe to do so wins immunity and will have a latrine installed at their camp, the second tribe will only win immunity, and the third-place tribe will go to tribal council.

Bag Collectors: $c[Denine and Louie], $o[Ashleia and Saul], $q[Khall and Paula]
Conveyor Belt Crankers: $c[Buddy and Jennifer], $o[Jarrett and Rocky], $q[Monty and Vaclav]
Throwers: $c[Rhett], $o[Candace], $q[Jackie]

Chalpe is quickly weighed down by Louie tripping immediately upon the challenge starting, leaving Denine to pick up the slack.

Paula retrieves her tribe&#39;s first bag and puts it on the conveyor. Vaclav starts cranking as hard as he can, and Monty struggles to keep up, much to Vaclav&#39;s surprise.

Denine and Saul deliver their first bags, and their tribes start to crank faster than Quibas can. Khall and Ashleia waste no time in adding their bags to the moving conveyor belts.

The first bag reaches Jackie, and she opens it to find three rocks. After throwing all three she only breaks one tile.

Rhett and Candace get their first bags. Rhett hits two tiles and Candace misses every time.

Louie finally delivers his first bag just as Paula brings her second. The next bags then reach Jackie and Candace, and they each break two.

Denine, Saul, Ashleia, and Khall all deliver bags at around the same time.

Buddy and Jennifer continue to crank quickly and in unison. Monty is cranking the conveyor belt carefully, with Vaclav closely mirroring his speed. Meanwhile Jarrett and Rocky are both pushing themselves, with Jarrett starting to get a bit overwhelmed.

Rhett and Jackie open the next pair of bags. Rhett hits one tile, and Jackie manages to break all three. Jackie now has three tiles left, Rhett has six, and Candace has seven.

When the next round of bags comes in, all three throwers scramble to open their bags. Rhett breaks two tiles, Candace breaks two tiles, and Jackie breaks one and throws another through where a tile used to be.

As the bags begin to pile up, Jarrett&#39;s cranking begins to slow down, much to Rocky&#39;s annoyance. Rocky insults Jarrett&#39;s &quot;noodle arms&quot; and tries to do the cranking by himself. He quickly discovers how much he needs Jarrett&#39;s input.

Eventually, after missing completely with one bag, Jackie breaks both of her remaining tiles with the next bag of rocks.

$q[Quibas wins immunity and a latrine for their camp!]

Rhett and Candace, having failed to close the gap, are stuck waiting for the conveyor belts to give them more bags.

A combination of Rhett&#39;s better focus and Jennifer and Buddy&#39;s higher stamina allows Rhett to clinch the victory while Candace has only one tile left to break.

$c[Chalpe wins immunity!]
$o[Ochora loses and will have to vote out someone at tribal council.]

The defeated Ochora is instructed to pick someone from Quibas to kidnap, additionally being told they cannot pick Paula. Jarrett quickly chooses Jackie to head with them back to camp.

$c[**Chalpe**]

Jennifer and Buddy have a quick exchange right after they return to camp.

&quot;It&#39;s not first, but we aren&#39;t losing anyone tonight,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;See how much more capable we can be without Lisa?&quot;

Jennifer smiles. &quot;I think you&#39;ve made your point, Buddy. Consider this an apology of sorts for jumping on the bandwagon.&quot;

Buddy shrugs. &quot;I see why you did it. Honestly, I would have if I was in your position.&quot;

&quot;Whew, thank goodness.&quot; Jennifer puts a hand on Buddy&#39;s shoulder. &quot;And worst case, you wouldn&#39;t have gone anywhere if we lost tonight.&quot;

Buddy&#39;s eyes light up. &quot;So, you&#39;re saying... we&#39;re cool?&quot;

&quot;Cool enough to trust you to vote out Louie with us,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;He&#39;s a liability now, and I honestly think it&#39;s worth maybe having Denine pissy at us for a while.&quot;

&quot;But if Ochora gets dissolved and we get two new members tomorrow,&quot; Buddy asks, &quot;how do we make sure that those two side with us and not Denine and Louie?&quot;

&quot;Honestly, we might not need to,&quot; Jennifer replies. &quot;If we somehow get Rocky, we take his ass out first. Then we just make sure whoever&#39;s left can see exactly what those two contribute around here.&quot;

//&quot;I&#39;m dreading the possibility that Rocky survives twice and ends up here,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;That one half-day he was here was miserable for all of us, and if he acts like that when we need to depend on each other, I&#39;m not going to let it slide.&quot;//

//&quot;Jennifer has completely changed her tone, and it&#39;s a welcome change to have someone else see what I&#39;ve been seeing the whole time,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;Denine and Louie do nothing around camp. I would have thrown the challenge if I knew that was the consensus. It&#39;s a little late for that, but there&#39;s nothing for me to cry over – I&#39;m finally not on the bottom!&quot;// 

$o[**Ochora**]

Candace, Jarrett, Saul, and Ashleia are discussing what to do by the fire pit.

&quot;This is obvious, right? We just vote Rocky out and be done with it?&quot; Candace asks.

Candace nods. &quot;We have that deal with Jackie, right? We picked exactly the right person to do this with.&quot;

&quot;There is an arrangement in place with that entire tribe to vote him out,&quot; says Saul. &quot;No matter what, we cannot falter on this.&quot;

Everyone agrees.

//&quot;An arrangement with the entire tribe? I don&#39;t recall making a deal with anyone besides Jackie, or else I would have picked someone besides Jackie,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;I don&#39;t know what he meant by that, but it can&#39;t be good.&quot;//

Rocky, meanwhile, has decided to give Jackie an impassioned plea for survival.

&quot;If you want to work with these chumps, go ahead,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;I won&#39;t stop you, but it will be your last mistake.&quot;

&quot;Uh huh,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;And who do you want out?&quot;

Rocky shrugs. &quot;Take your pick! Jarrett, Saul, Ashleia, they&#39;re all problems I need dealt with. Just tell me who you&#39;re voting for, and I&#39;ll pull some strings to make that happen.&quot;

//&quot;I don&#39;t care about what Jackie is doing, I just want her to stay out of my way,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;I want her to vote for anyone that isn&#39;t someone I care about, so all I need is two people voting the way I want them to... and I know exactly who to use.&quot;//

Candace is busy looking at the post which holds the treemail box. She gently lifts the treemail box off of a small shelf, revealing that it was covering a small item wrapped with paper and tied with twine. She excitedly grabs the trinket and replaces the treemail box.

&quot;This better be it, but I have no time to check...&quot; she says to herself. She tucks the package into her pocket and briskly walks back to the shelter, where she runs into Jarrett.

&quot;Hey Jarrett,&quot; she says, &quot;have you seen Rocky at all recently?&quot;

&quot;Can’t say that I have,&quot; Jarrett replies. &quot;But do you think he found the idol?&quot;

Candace tenses up slightly. &quot;Jarrett, I&#39;ve told you before. I would have sensed it. He&#39;s still emanating some anxiety, but if he had the idol, he would be ready to play it tonight.&quot;

&quot;See, the others think he does have it,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;Saul has a plan to coax the idol out of him. He&#39;s trying to convince Ashleia and Jackie to vote against you instead.&quot;

//&quot;I thought Saul was the paragon of purity and forgiveness, but I think his behaviour towards Candace and Rocky recently has been more than telling,&quot; Jarrett explains. &quot;The only problem is Rocky has proven he can turn the tide in his favour.&quot;//

&quot;And he thinks he can just get away with it?&quot; Candace crosses her arms. &quot;You know what, no. Rocky sucks, but if we can keep him over Min-Ji we can keep him over Saul. I&#39;m voting him out.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not too late to do that?&quot; Jarrett asks.

&quot;Not if we tell Rocky,&quot; says Candace. &quot;How do we know he isn&#39;t already trying to scramble the vote up as we speak? If just one person flakes, we can take Saul out.&quot;

//&quot;What makes you think it&#39;s a good idea to overplay like that when you KNOW how that ended up for someone just five days ago?&quot; Candace exclaims. &quot;When I see something like that, I will absolutely call it out. I&#39;m not going to stand for it!&quot;//

&quot;Should one of us go talk to him?&quot; Jarrett asks.

&quot;What do you think?&quot; Candace asks calmly. &quot;Who can make the better pitch?&quot;

&quot;What if we both tell him, so he sees he does have the numbers?&quot;

&quot;We can do that.&quot; Candace shakes Jarrett&#39;s hand.

Meanwhile, Saul is busy talking to Jackie.

&quot;Have you already been informed by Paula about my proposition?&quot; Saul asks.

Jackie shakes her head. &quot;I don&#39;t even listen to half of what she says anymore. And the other half is not strategy.&quot;

&quot;I have proposed that I will join forces with any member of your tribe to support your goals,&quot; Saul explains, &quot;as I have lost faith in some members of this tribe.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s nice. Tell me how I should vote,&quot; says Jackie.

&quot;Rocky,&quot; says Saul. &quot;Ashleia is with me on this. The other two are simply not options at this point in time.&quot;

&quot;I see.&quot; Jackie rubs her chin in thought. &quot;Okay, so you want me to just vote him and nobody else.&quot;

&quot;Correct.&quot;

//&quot;I want to show Jackie that she can trust me, despite her quarrels with Paula,&quot; says Saul. &quot;I am not a privy to those, I am only aware of the problems I may face if I continue to put Ochora first. I will determine tonight who I can pursue a common agenda with.&quot;//

$v[**Tribal Council**]

The Ochora Tribe, with Jackie, walks into the tribal council building. Each of them have already ignited their torches, and simply place them behind the seats.

$v[&quot;Welcome back, all of you. Jarrett, last challenge you were all on your own, and you pulled off your first win. But every time you need to work together, you wind up here. Is that a pattern?&quot;]

&quot;It might be,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;I&#39;d like to think that we can get along and work together. But I guess we don&#39;t work well when we&#39;re forced to watch each other&#39;s every move.&quot;

$v[&quot;Watching each other&#39;s every move? Jarrett, it&#39;s called communication.&quot;]

&quot;Then I guess that&#39;s the problem?&quot; Jarrett shrugs.

$v[&quot;Saul, does this tribe have a communication problem?&quot;]

&quot;No, I think we have communicated our goals effectively,&quot; says Saul. &quot;I believe it is merely pressure of challenges that holds us back. We find it difficult to rely on and trust each other.&quot;

$v[&quot;Rocky, I can&#39;t help but feel this is directed towards you.&quot;]

&quot;Of course, it is,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;I don&#39;t like him. I don&#39;t want to have to rely on him for anything.&quot;

&quot;I wish you could only put that aside for us to work better and not be faced with elimination,&quot; Saul replies.

&quot;And I wish //you// would stop being such a goody goody snoozefest,&quot; Rocky snaps. &quot;But some of us have principles.&quot;

&quot;This is the problem,&quot; says Saul.

&quot;Oh, sure, I&#39;m the problem. You&#39;ve had it out for me since the start.&quot; Rocky scowls.

&quot;Because you&#39;ve been acting like this the whole time!&quot; Candace snaps. &quot;You&#39;re on the bottom because you&#39;re toxic!&quot;

&quot;Says you,&quot; says Rocky, &quot;but you know what will happen if you vote me out.&quot;

$v[&quot;Ashleia, a lot of these arguments came up last time, and we saw Min-Ji leave instead. What makes this time different?&quot;]

&quot;I don&#39;t know if it is different yet,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;But we don&#39;t have someone caught in a lie right now. There is only one person left that is, like, doing us harm I guess?&quot;

&quot;So, you&#39;ll do absolutely anything to get rid of me?&quot; Rocky asks. &quot;Now, tell me. What if I happened to be... safe tonight?&quot;

&quot;Umm...&quot; Ashleia stops to think. &quot;I don&#39;t know, really. But I&#39;m... I&#39;m still voting you out tonight.&quot;

Rocky rolls his eyes and chuckles.

$v[&quot;Jackie, where do you stand on this? Would it be better for you to score some points with another tribe, or make a big move to further your own game?&quot;]

&quot;Right now, I&#39;m trying to further my own game,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;I don&#39;t have to worry about having a target on my back, so I&#39;m just looking for what will put me in the best spot going forward.&quot;

&quot;Do you want one grateful person,&quot; says Saul, &quot;or do you want four?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not going to do what I&#39;m about to do so I can have people be grateful,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;I want allies. And if you can&#39;t help me, then you can get out.&quot;

$v[&quot;You do not want to give up immunity, then?&quot;]

Jackie crosses her arms. &quot;No way.&quot;

$v[&quot;Then it&#39;s time to vote. Rocky, you are up first.&quot;]

...

Rocky reveals his vote to be for **Saul**. &quot;Get well soon but do it someplace else.&quot;

Saul reveals his vote to be for **Rocky**. &quot;I envisioned a smaller but successful tribe. You, my friend, are dead weight.&quot;

Jackie writes down her vote but does not reveal it. &quot;I see what&#39;s really going on here. You might deny it but you&#39;re my biggest threat.&quot;

...

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$v[&quot;Saul.&quot;]

Saul closes his eyes, but otherwise does not react.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$v[&quot;Candace. That is one vote each for Saul and Candace.&quot;]

&quot;Wait, what?&quot; Ashleia looks confused.

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Candace asks. &quot;This was your plan, wasn&#39;t it?&quot;

$v[&quot;Rocky. One vote each, three votes left.&quot;]

Candace stops, now looking more confused than Ashleia.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$v[&quot;Rocky. Two votes Rocky, one each for Saul and Candace.&quot;]

&quot;That&#39;s my vote,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;I thought we were sticking with the same plan?&quot;

&quot;I could have sworn you-&quot; Candace stops. &quot;Oh God.&quot;

$v[&quot;Next vote... Saul. One vote left.&quot;]

&quot;Well, thank you for the pleasant experience,&quot; says Saul.

&quot;Jarrett,&quot; Candace asks with an icy glare, &quot;what did you do?&quot;

Jarrett tries to look away from Candace, while Rocky can barely keep himself together.

$v[&quot;Final vote, and the fourth $boot, is **Saul**. You need to bring me your torch.&quot;]

&quot;I can&#39;t believe it...&quot; Ashleia looks almost forlorn.

&quot;That was beautiful,&quot; says Rocky.

&quot;You assholes!&quot; Candace yells. &quot;I can&#39;t believe you would... ARGH!&quot;

Saul leans over and gives Ashleia a hug, before getting up and bringing his torch over to Vincent.

$v[&quot;Saul, the tribe has spoken.&quot;] Vincent extinguishes the pale man&#39;s torch. $v[&quot;Time for you to go.&quot;]

Saul heads out the door with his head held high. Ashleia looks hurt, and Jackie is busy taking in the scene around her, but both watch Saul as he walks out.

$v[&quot;And once again we have a supposed consensus spoiled by a blindside,&quot;] says Vincent, $v[&quot;but this time could be the real start of this game for you. You can head back to camp.&quot;]
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$o[//&quot;I suppose my intuition was a bit too accurate for my own good,&quot; says Saul. &quot;The first vote was upsetting to me, and I believe I might have lost it there and been unable to recover. I merely hope that Ashleia has better luck than me and does not repeat my mistakes.&quot;//]

Voting Results:
**Saul - Candace, Jarrett, Rocky**

&quot;You know, you could have just told me the truth instead of leaving me in the dark like that,&quot; says Jackie.

&quot;We DID tell you the truth,&quot; says Candace. &quot;We said to vote Rocky, and then you go ahead and try to backstab me? I don&#39;t know about what happens on Quibas, but you can&#39;t expect to get away with that here.&quot;

&quot;Well, to be honest,&quot; says Jackie, &quot;that&#39;s your guys&#39; fault that you don&#39;t know how to actually play the game.&quot;

&quot;Excuse me!&quot; Candace snaps.

Jackie huffs, and crosses her arms. &quot;Is it wrong to assume you were trying to tell me something by saying everyone&#39;s name BUT Candace&#39;s? How could I have known that you didn&#39;t want her out?&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t Saul and Ash tell you they were going to blindside me?&quot;

&quot;Oh, is that what you told her?&quot; Rocky smirks at Jarrett.

&quot;Yeah, elaborate,&quot; Candace snaps. &quot;What the fuck, Jarrett!?&quot;

//&quot;This is too perfect!&quot; Rocky grins widely. &quot;Not only did I get yet another bore out, but it was under the guise of protecting myself, and it&#39;s Jarrett who went **out of his way** to take all the blame for it! Ha ha! He was the new tribe leader, he has no excuse!&quot;//

&quot;Look, Candace, I&#39;m sorry for lying to you,&quot; says Jarrett, &quot;but I couldn&#39;t convince Ashleia to turn on him. And like it or not, Rocky&#39;s not the one who went behind our backs to cut a better deal for himself.&quot;

&quot;He wouldn&#39;t betray us!&quot; Ashleia exclaims. &quot;Is that why you did it?&quot;

&quot;Saul told us that he had a deal with the whole tribe. We only had one with Jackie and her weird friend,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;I couldn&#39;t take the chance that he would flip on us.&quot;

&quot;Um, I never heard about this!&quot; Jackie protests. &quot;Saul wasn&#39;t connected to us any more than you were.&quot;

&quot;Did you ask Paula and Monty?&quot; asks Jarrett.

&quot;He allied with WHO!?&quot; Jackie clenches her fists. &quot;Oh. My God. Why didn&#39;t you just say so!&quot;

&quot;He liked us, Jarrett, he wouldn&#39;t have wanted to flip,&quot; says Ashleia.

&quot;You never know,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;I didn&#39;t know if the first vote would be held against us.&quot;

//&quot;I couldn&#39;t have done it any other time,&quot; Jarrett explains. &quot;Saul just was too dangerous. If his premonitions were real, that could help him in a way that it could never help Rocky. And now the swap should be fast approaching, and we&#39;ll have more important things to worry about than a little white lie. At least, I hope I don&#39;t have to re-evaluate my standing with Candace.&quot;//

&quot;Well now you can&#39;t really get rid of me since you need the strength,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;Good work.&quot;

&quot;I have more strength than you do,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;Spray painting railway cars isn&#39;t exercise.&quot;

&quot;Neither is being a huge dork,&quot; says Rocky, &quot;and yet that one guy on Jackie&#39;s tribe seems to be benefitting from it. So, I don&#39;t know what happened with you.&quot;

&quot;You think Vaclav is a dork?&quot; Jackie asks, slightly offended on his behalf.

&quot;With a name like that? Of course,&quot; says Rocky.

//&quot;Rocky needs to learn to shut the hell up,&quot; says Candace. &quot;And then he needs to do that... forever. His voice is like trying to start a car when the engine&#39;s already running! Why is that stupid burnout so arrogant?!&quot;//

$c[**Chalpe**]

&quot;If we won that challenge, you know he&#39;d be gone,&quot; says Rhett.

The entire tribe is sitting between the firepit and the shelter, discussing the tribal council.

&quot;It sounds to me like they don&#39;t like him any more than we do,&quot; Jennifer replies. &quot;I&#39;d say it&#39;s likely they voted him out. If they didn&#39;t, then that&#39;s just giving the five of us a freebie.&quot;

Rhett nods. &quot;If Rocky is still around by the halfway point it&#39;s because the production team wants him to be around.&quot;

&quot;Or maybe he&#39;s actually a capable player behind all that immaturity,&quot; says Denine.

Buddy scoffs. &quot;With his social skills? No way, I&#39;d chalk it up to luck.&quot;

&quot;I mean he&#39;s still more likable than you are,&quot; says Louie.

&quot;You really think that?&quot; Buddy snaps. &quot;Because that&#39;s bull. It&#39;s not my fault if you take offense when-&quot;

&quot;Everything that&#39;s gone wrong here can be traced back to you.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re blaming ME for LISA? Are you high!?&quot;

//&quot;Louie has absolutely no right to be that smug,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;He makes drama instead of making food. He&#39;s trying to slander me even when nobody believes him. I&#39;m never going to work with that waste of space, and you can count on that.&quot;//

&quot;Don&#39;t try to twist my words to suit your little narrative,&quot; says Louie.

&quot;I&#39;m not doing that,&quot; Buddy interjects. &quot;I&#39;m responding to what you just said.&quot;

&quot;You didn&#39;t take the context into account,&quot; Louie replies calmly.

&quot;Context? What context?&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;That was the first thing you said.&quot;

&quot;Nobody asked you, Jennifer!&quot; Louie snaps.

&quot;Nobody asked for your input either,&quot; says Jennifer.

//&quot;Jennifer needs to get her ego in check,&quot; says Louie. &quot;She&#39;s not the boss of any of us. She&#39;s not a judge. We let her speak for the tribe one time on the first day, for a decision we were all in agreement on!&quot;//

&quot;We&#39;re forgetting the important thing here,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;When Rocky was here, he caused more needless frustration and agitation than anyone actually on this tribe. If Ochora doesn&#39;t make the right decision and vote him out, we need to band together and clean up their mess.&quot;

&quot;I think that&#39;s a good short-term goal,&quot; says Denine. &quot;If we get the opportunity to take him out, we should have a truce until that can happen.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t like the idea that we need a truce,&quot; Jennifer replies. &quot;Aren&#39;t we a team?&quot;

&quot;Personally, I don&#39;t feel any team spirit,&quot; says Louie.

&quot;That doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;We just need to focus on making sure nobody on the other tribes can have the game handed to them on a silver platter!&quot;

//&quot;Yes, we&#39;ve established that Rocky sucks, it helps me get to sleep every night,&quot; says Denine. &quot;But saying he&#39;s done more bad than anyone here combined? Rhett&#39;s a mental case, now. Just look at who we&#39;re dealing with to see how untrue that is.&quot;//

$q[**Quibas**]

Paula and Monty are sitting together in the shelter.

&quot;I&#39;ve been stewing on something for a little while,&quot; says Paula. &quot;I want to tell you and only you because I think you&#39;ll... be cool with it in a way nobody else really can be.&quot;

&quot;Go on,&quot; says Monty.

&quot;You aren&#39;t the only person here that I feel close to,&quot; Paula admits.

&quot;Do you have feelings for Vadsy?&quot; Monty asks.

&quot;What? No, no I don&#39;t!&quot; Paula protests.

&quot;I know young love when I see it,&quot; says Monty. &quot;You ain&#39;t head over heels crazy, but he&#39;s lit a spark in-&quot;

&quot;No, he hasn&#39;t, moving on!&quot;

//&quot;It&#39;s been long enough, in game terms, that I can trust Monty with knowing more about me,&quot; Paula admits. &quot;Particularly, the fact that I&#39;m friends with Buddy from outside the game. I told him that I know he can rely on Buddy the same way I can, if he ever needs it.&quot;//

&quot;That&#39;s not against the rules, is it?&quot; Monty asks.

&quot;We didn&#39;t plan this,&quot; Paula replies, &quot;but it&#39;s an opportunity I&#39;m not going to pass up. And you&#39;ve been such a good friend, and I know you won&#39;t use this against me.&quot;

&quot;I would never sell you out,&quot; says Monty, before spitting on the ground.

&quot;That&#39;s why you need to promise me to not tell anyone else,&quot; says Paula. &quot;I beg of you. We both know Jackie and Khall can&#39;t be trusted, and if Vaclav finds out then he&#39;ll have power over not only me, but also you and Buddy.&quot;

&quot;I promise I won&#39;t tell anyone that you&#39;re friends with him,&quot; Monty replies.

//&quot;I thank Paula for tellin&#39; me,&quot; says Monty. &quot;It shows she&#39;s not trying to use me. I knew she was an honest girl.&quot;//

Meanwhile, Vaclav is talking to Khall.

&quot;Are you worried about what will happen today?&quot; Vaclav asks.

&quot;I am,&quot; says Khall. &quot;The new latrine we got... it rubs me the wrong way. It&#39;s like there&#39;s something inside waiting to come out.&quot;

&quot;Out of the latrine? What could possibly-&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know, but there&#39;s something about dark circular holes,&quot; Khall explains. &quot;They give me the creeps. I don&#39;t like not being able to see what&#39;s at the other end of something.&quot;

Vaclav stares blankly at Khall&#39;s face, which is still completely obscured by a shadow cast by his hood. &quot;Really.&quot;

&quot;I think we need to take turns watching it to make sure no reality warpers use it as a gateway to this dimension.&quot; Khall sighs. &quot;Especially not conventionally attractive young men with colour-coordinated outfits. I&#39;ve had my fair share of those already, and I know this season is supposed to be more grounded in realism.&quot;

&quot;I was talking about the swap!&quot; Vaclav shouts. &quot;Are you not afraid that we&#39;re going to lose this tribe or the rewards?&quot;

Khall nods. &quot;You&#39;re the only other one I trust to keep watch on the latrine. One of us needs to be here or bad things will happen!&quot;

&quot;Stop talking about the latrine!&quot; Vaclav goes slightly pale. &quot;I&#39;ve worked really, **really** hard to keep this group together. I think my position is okay. I don&#39;t want to be at the bottom. And if the people I&#39;ve known for over a week can&#39;t be trusted, then anyone I&#39;ve only seen for a few minutes at most outside challenges... they definitely can&#39;t be!&quot;

//&quot;This is the anxiety I&#39;m worried about with him,&quot; says Khall. &quot;It&#39;s smart to be aware of your surroundings, but he&#39;s trying to invent things for him to see. He is the only one worried as much as he is, and it doesn&#39;t look good on him.&quot;//

**Reward Challenge**

As the tribes coalesce in the challenge area, Buddy has a quick confessional saying that he&#39;s ready for a shake-up. He says it would be good to be around new people that he can start fresh with, and even better to maybe be able to actually work together with Paula.
Vincent tells the tribes that Quibas&#39;s secret advantage from the previous challenge is that they are not going to be dissolved. He says the tribe with the worse challenge history will be dissolved, and that happens to be $o[Ochora].
Denine asks if Ochora will be divided between the two remaining tribes, and is told no, that both tribes will completely swap.

Vincent reveals two platforms, each with seven buckets and a rope attached. One platform is labeled $q[Quibas], and one is labeled $c[Chalpe]. He instructs the non-dissolved tribes to stand underneath the bucket on their tribe&#39;s platform and grab a hold of the rope. He then tells the four members of Ochora to pick one of the four vacant buckets.
Candace and Ashleia go to the Quibas side, and Jarrett and Rocky go to the Chalpe side.

$v[&quot;In these buckets are water that is coloured either indigo or light pink. If you get covered in indigo water, you will go to Quibas. If you get covered in light pink water, you will go to Chalpe. Quibas side, when I say pull, pull your rope. Three, two, one, //pull!//&quot;]

(colour: blue + blue + white)[//Splash!//]

$q[Jackie, Khall, Monty, and Paula remain on the Quibas tribe.]
$c[Ashleia, Candace, and Vaclav will be heading to Chalpe.]

Vincent turns to the Chalpe side. $v[&quot;Old Chalpe, as well as Jarrett and Rocky. Three of you will go to Quibas, while four of you will go to Chalpe. Three, two, one, //pull!//&quot;]

(colour: blue + blue + white)[//Splash!//]

$q[Denine, Jennifer, and Rocky will be heading to Quibas.]
$c[Buddy, Louie, and Rhett remain on Chalpe, and Jarrett will join them.]

$v[&quot;Since Ochora did not have anything but a tarp to their name, I will be taking it back, and no rewards are being moved. You all can head out.&quot;]

**Day 12, After the Swap**
$q[**Quibas**]

Jackie, Khall, Monty, and Paula arrive back at camp. They stop and turn around, watching Denine, Jennifer, and Rocky follow them into the clearing.

&quot;You&#39;re part of a winning tribe now,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;We have, like, the best record, and we&#39;re hoping you three can help us out with that. But I do NOT have high hopes.&quot;

&quot;Shut up, Jackie,&quot; says Paula. &quot;Make yourselves comfortable, guys.&quot;

&quot;Comfortable? In this dump?&quot; Rocky crosses his arms.

&quot;Shut up, Rocky,&quot; says Jennifer.

&quot;He&#39;s right, though,&quot; Denine adds.

//&quot;Let&#39;s see, I lost Louie, so that sucks,&quot; says Denine. &quot;I lost Rhett, too, in case he ever decided to stop being a moron. And now I&#39;m in the minority with fucking Rocky. Shoot me now.&quot;//

&quot;Do you two girls have any history we should be knowin&#39; about?&quot; Monty asks, looking at Jennifer and Denine.

&quot;I hope not,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;She&#39;s alright.&quot;

&quot;Jennifer&#39;s okay,&quot; says Denine.

Both show their displeasure at the other&#39;s half-hearted answer.

&quot;Off to a great start,&quot; Khall says in monotone.

&quot;It will be a great start if you guys are fun to be around,&quot; says Rocky.

&quot;You won&#39;t like his definition of fun,&quot; says Jennifer.

Rocky smirks. &quot;I never said it would be fun for the rest of you.&quot;

//&quot;So the three new people are coming in with some baggage, which is great news for us,&quot; says Paula. &quot;As much as Jackie&#39;s been a pain in the neck, I know better than to be petty when we barely have the numbers. Let them not get along, and our four can just pressure them into turning on each other.&quot;//

$c[**Chalpe**]

Rhett leads the new members of the tribe – Ashleia, Candace, Jarrett, and Vaclav – to the Chalpe site, since Buddy and Louie refused to let each other do it.

&quot;If you have any questions, just ask,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter what happened before, you have a clean slate here. Welcome to Chalpe.&quot;

&quot;I find that hard to believe,&quot; says Vaclav.

&quot;Are you trying to start something?&quot; Rhett asks.

&quot;No, not at all! I just have every right to be wary,&quot; Vaclav explains. &quot;I&#39;m the only one here from my own tribe, all of the rest of you have two people you&#39;re familiar with. The kidnapping twist means you don&#39;t need me as a swing vote. I don&#39;t like my new position here, is that fair for me to say?&quot;

&quot;It might not have been the appropriate time,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;He&#39;s trying to be, like, a gracious host. Which is more than I can say for the others.&quot;

&quot;And a good afternoon to you too.&quot; Louie glares.

//&quot;I was hoping that I didn&#39;t end up somewhere dysfunctional again,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;Though between having to deal with Louie and Buddy&#39;s fighting, and Vaclav&#39;s playing the victim, I have my work cut out for me.&quot;//

&quot;Anyways... it&#39;s nice to meet you guys!&quot; Buddy smiles warmly. &quot;I&#39;m Buddy, this is Rhett, and the one who&#39;s... already asleep it seems is Louie.&quot; He extends his hand.

Candace takes his hand and shakes it firmly. &quot;Candace. And that&#39;s Ashleia and Jarrett.&quot;

Buddy looks over at Vaclav, expecting an answer.

Vaclav nods and says his name quietly.

&quot;There&#39;s really nothing to be awkward over,&quot; says Buddy, letting go of Candace&#39;s hand. &quot;You have a full day to get to know us, after all.&quot;

//&quot;I just want to make a good first impression on the newcomers, since now there are more of them than of us,&quot; explains Buddy. &quot;Which is great, honestly, if they can use those numbers to get rid of Louie. I think voting out Lisa emboldened him somehow, which is absurd because I did that. I&#39;m willing to give Vaclav some adjustment time to see that he&#39;s not the obvious target.&quot;//

&lt;span class=&#39;newday&#39;&gt;[[Day 13&lt;-Read Day 13]]&lt;/span&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="Day 13" tags="" position="791,620" size="100,100">$c[**Chalpe**]

The five males of the tribe are sitting around the fire. Jarrett is stroking his chin while talking to Vaclav, while Buddy, Louie, and Rhett are mostly just listening.

&quot;You know those guys better than all of us,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;But now you&#39;re on our tribe so that means they&#39;re the enemy. None of us know anything about any of them.&quot;

Buddy winces. Rhett sees this out of the corner of his eye but doesn&#39;t react.

&quot;So why should I just give you all I know?&quot; Vaclav replies. &quot;Seems to me like you just want to use me for information.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s information we&#39;ll find out eventually, anyways,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;But you guys were really strong once you ditched the dead weight.&quot;

&quot;There won&#39;t be two swaps,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;The next time we&#39;ll be sharing a camp with Quibas is at the merge, and then there&#39;s no teams.&quot;

&quot;You want me to tell you guys how to use their abilities?&quot; Vaclav asks.

&quot;Why not?&quot; says Buddy.

//&quot;I would like to know what Vaclav knows about the other tribe,&quot; says Buddy, &quot;because there&#39;s some things that Paula knows better than to tell me. There&#39;s no more Ochora to team up against, we have to either beat them or we lose.&quot;//

&quot;To be perfectly honest... I don&#39;t really know.&quot; Vaclav clasps his hands together. &quot;If something is going to bring them down, it might be internal. They don&#39;t really get along.&quot;

&quot;Then let&#39;s make sure we don&#39;t have those problems ourselves,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;That means you.&quot; He looks over at Buddy and Louie. &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter what happened before we got here. Circumstances are different now, the least you two can do is be civilized.&quot;

&quot;Or don&#39;t interact with each other, if that&#39;s what it takes,&quot; adds Rhett.

&quot;You don&#39;t have a lot of faith in them, do you?&quot; Vaclav asks.

&quot;You need to have been here,&quot; says Rhett.

&quot;I hope we can put it aside.&quot; Buddy looks over at Louie. &quot;Being angry all the time is exhausting.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m tired of it too,&quot; says Louie. &quot;Just don&#39;t do anything selfish and we&#39;ll be fine.&quot;

&quot;I guess that&#39;s the best I&#39;m going to get out of you,&quot; Buddy mutters.

//&quot;I don&#39;t play games with people. I tell them exactly what I think of them,&quot; says Louie. &quot;And if that&#39;s a problem for Buddy, or Rhett, or any of these new guys, I don&#39;t care. And if I can&#39;t get rid of someone who gets in my way, I will make their life hell.&quot;//

&quot;Maybe I should give you guys a minute,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;I have all I need.&quot; He gets up and walks away from the others.

After waiting a minute, Jarrett speaks up. &quot;I&#39;m serious about you needing to put the past in the past,&quot; he says.

Louie rolls his eyes. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, are we supposed to &#39;try harder&#39; or something?&quot;

&quot;More like, &#39;keep your damn mouth shut&#39;,&quot; Jarrett snaps. &quot;I&#39;m not going to be on a tribe of losers again. The girls are fine with me, and I already don&#39;t like the look of Vaclav. If we lose, we take him out.&quot;

&quot;You sure he isn&#39;t the reason his tribe was winning so much?&quot; Rhett asks. &quot;We shouldn&#39;t vote out a strong player. We need to win challenges so Rocky&#39;s tribe can not win challenges.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;Physical, maybe, but really timid. If we&#39;re counting on him to win something for all of us, he&#39;ll fold like a wet paper towel.&quot;

//&quot;It makes sense that Jarrett doesn&#39;t want us to consider voting out one of the women,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;They&#39;re from his tribe, they&#39;re numbers in his corner. But they blew two opportunities to cut out the cancer, and nobody should get away with inflicting that on the rest of us.&quot;//

$q[**Quibas**]

Paula is standing near where Monty, Jackie, and Khall are sitting. She is watching Rocky trying to repair the shelter.

&quot;Why did you guys use so many leaves and stuff?&quot; Rocky mutters to himself. &quot;This weaving business is frustrating. We all got tarps, didn&#39;t we?&quot;

Paula shakes her head.

//&quot;I thought the whole point of getting a tarp was that we wouldn&#39;t have to put up with this leaf weaving business,&quot; Rocky explains. &quot;Jarrett and I didn&#39;t do it, and we didn&#39;t get soaked at night. It all feels redundant, but since Denine and Jennifer already don&#39;t like me, I should try and earn some points with the other guys.&quot;//

After snapping one too many leaves, Rocky tosses his shoddy handiwork into the firepit.

Paula looks back to her other tribemates. &quot;I think we should make sure we&#39;re on the same page.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Monty asks.

&quot;The four of us, we all know each other,&quot; says Paula. &quot;I know we don&#39;t exactly get along, but sometimes it&#39;s the devil you know versus the devil you don&#39;t. We need to keep each other safe.&quot;

Monty and Khall nod, while Jackie has no expression.

&quot;There are four of us, and if we can&#39;t get Vaclav back then we&#39;re deadlocked,&quot; Paula explains. &quot;That&#39;s a tempting target for the other three to maybe lower our numbers.&quot;

&quot;So we should make sure those three don&#39;t like each other,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;Then they won&#39;t team up.&quot;

&quot;We could also ask someone to side with us,&quot; says Khall. &quot;You don&#39;t just vote someone out because you don&#39;t like them.&quot;

//&quot;I didn&#39;t want to vote anyone out before,&quot; says Khall. &quot;Everyone is just that nice. We have a chance to all keep each other, and I think we should try and do that.&quot;//

&quot;From what I&#39;ve seen of Rocky, I&#39;m not sure we should really associate with him unless we absolutely have to,&quot; says Paula.

&quot;So that leaves one of the girls,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;That&#39;s, like, great because I work better with girls anyways.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think you do,&quot; Paula replies.

&quot;We&#39;ll see about that,&quot; says Jackie.

//&quot;Okay, so I&#39;m going to just let Paula and Monty think what they want to think for now,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;But I know when things start getting difficult, they&#39;re going to have to come to me and play by my rules. We have four, they have four, so if they want to keep that four, they need to listen to me.&quot;//

$c[**Chalpe**]

Ashleia is standing by the well, taking a small amount of water to splash her face with.

&quot;You might not want to do that,&quot; says Buddy, standing nearby. &quot;That&#39;s our only source of water.&quot;

&quot;Oh, sorry,&quot; says Ashleia sheepishly. &quot;I just needed to freshen up a little, I guess.&quot;

Buddy inhales, preparing to say something, then stops himself. &quot;Okay, I understand. Sorry, Ashleia. Can I tell you something?&quot;

&quot;I mean, go ahead,&quot; says Ashleia.

&quot;Okay, so the guys and I were just talking.&quot; Buddy crosses his eyes. &quot;Jarrett says he wants us to agree to vote out Vaclav.&quot;

&quot;Well, that&#39;s fine with me,&quot; she says. &quot;I just wish he told me first.&quot;

&quot;Were the two of you close, when you were on Ochora?&quot; Buddy asks.

Ashleia nods. &quot;We worked together, at first. But then he went behind our backs to vote out Saul.&quot;

&quot;So that&#39;s who I have to thank for Rhett&#39;s recent obsession? Good to know.&quot;

//&quot;Am I happy with Jarrett for how he, like, played around last time? No, I&#39;m not,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;But this is just, like, exactly why I don&#39;t like working with men like that, you know? I should remind him that I&#39;m capable, too.&quot;//

&quot;You don&#39;t want to get back at him, do you?&quot; Buddy asks.

Ashleia shakes her head. &quot;I&#39;m afraid of being next if I do that. I don&#39;t want to just follow his lead, though...&quot;

&quot;Then who do you want to vote out?&quot;

&quot;Can we, like, vote out Louie, maybe?&quot; Ashleia curls a lock of her hair in her fingers. &quot;I dunno, he&#39;s-&quot;

&quot;A smug little asshat who has it coming?&quot; Buddy&#39;s eyes light up as he says this.

&quot;...kind of overweight.&quot;

//&quot;Hell yes! It&#39;s only a matter of time until he starts up his irritating and not clever remarks again, anyways,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;Ashleia just met the damn guy and she&#39;s already on board. Now it&#39;s time for me to get to work on making this happen.&quot;//

Meanwhile, Louie is lying in the shelter, with his eyes closed. Vaclav is sitting next to him, twiddling his thumbs.

&quot;I feel like I was doing better on my old tribe, even if they might have been plotting to backdoor me,&quot; admits Vaclav. &quot;So this swap is frustrating for me. Can I even make a good impression when the odds were against me as soon as I picked up a pink buff?&quot;

&quot;You grow to hate that little piece of fabric,&quot; Louie says with a grunt.

&quot;The people who I thought kind of understood me,&quot; says Vaclav, &quot;aren&#39;t even here. I could go to the Town Square but that will just isolate me further. Either way I&#39;m alone and vulnerable.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, the only one here who wasn&#39;t terrible is on your old tribe now,&quot; says Louie. &quot;She needs to make it out alive. If I&#39;m stuck with all these jerkoffs at the merge without her, it won&#39;t be pretty.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be here to talk to,&quot; says Vaclav, &quot;it&#39;s not hopeless without her.&quot;

Louie makes a nondescript groan.

//&quot;Louie doesn&#39;t like anyone here,&quot; says Vaclav, &quot;and everyone else probably has it out for me already because this swap ruined me. So, we kind of have a common outlook. He&#39;s kind of mean, but I can&#39;t really be picky.&quot; He sighs. &quot;An immunity idol would be great right about now.&quot;//

$q[**Quibas**]

Jennifer and Denine are standing by a river that runs near the Quibas camp, using makeshift spears to try and catch some fish.

&quot;I was definitely hoping that we would still have the numbers after a swap,&quot; says Jennifer.

&quot;It&#39;s a bummer, yeah.&quot; Denine stabs at the river, missing everything. &quot;It&#39;s not over, though. We got a while.&quot;

&quot;Have you thought about what we&#39;re going to do yet?&quot; Jennifer asks.

&quot;Not really.&quot;

//&quot;When we first got here, we didn&#39;t jump into making alliances right away,&quot; says Denine. &quot;Well, at least I didn&#39;t. I don&#39;t see how right now is any different. I&#39;ll make my decision on where I stand when the time is right; I&#39;m not going to put myself in a box.&quot;//

&quot;We know Rocky, and we know that he&#39;s a jackass,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;So, unless we&#39;re the pinnacle of strength then he&#39;s a lost cause.&quot;

&quot;Mhm.&quot; Denine keeps focused on the river.

&quot;But there are four people on Quibas, and they haven&#39;t lost anyone since day 3,&quot; Jennifer continues. &quot;I think they might be ready to crack. I think Buddy said he was the swing vote, which means that they either have someone on the outs, or they&#39;re split right down the middle.&quot;

Denine doesn&#39;t say anything.

&quot;They could also not be as tight as it seems. We can try to get in there and claim to be united against Rocky,&quot; says Jennifer, &quot;but then make sure they vent all our problems to us. We can drive that wedge between them until they trust us more than each other. That right there is the ballgame.&quot;

&quot;So how are you going to do that?&quot; Denine asks. &quot;Sounds like you&#39;ve got it all figured out.&quot;

&quot;I need you with me one hundred percent,&quot; Jennifer replies. &quot;We need to tell them we can throw Rocky under the bus. From there, we each pick a side and make sure there&#39;s a rivalry.&quot;

&quot;Whatever works,&quot; says Denine.

&quot;Are you even listening to me?&quot; Jennifer asks, a little annoyed.

&quot;Good idea,&quot; says Denine.

Jennifer slams the pointed end of her spear into the sand. &quot;Hey, Denine, I&#39;m trying to help us out here. The least you could do is listen to me and not just bob your head. I am not going to do all the work.&quot;

&quot;So why even bother asking for my input?&quot; Denine asks. &quot;Sounds like you already know what you want us to do.&quot;

&quot;Well, is there anything wrong with what I&#39;m saying?&quot;

&quot;Gee, I just don&#39;t know, Jennifer!&quot;

//&quot;Gah! I don&#39;t know what you want from me, Jen!&quot; Denine crosses her arms. &quot;You have your own agenda, obviously. I&#39;m not going to question what&#39;s best for her, but she shouldn&#39;t pretend it&#39;s OUR plan. It&#39;s hers, and I&#39;ll treat it as such.&quot;//

After having left Denine to fish by herself, Jennifer gets a hold of Jackie on a narrow trail.

&quot;I think you should know,&quot; says Jennifer, &quot;that you&#39;re good with me. I&#39;m keeping watch on Denine and Rocky to make sure they&#39;re not coming for you.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;I&#39;ll look out for you too. If you have my back, I have yours.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re cool,&quot; says Jennifer.

&quot;I know I am,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;You know. We should be an alliance. Because right now, I just get a bad feeling about the others. I need someone solid.&quot;

&quot;Same here, I just got separated from my rock,&quot; explains Jennifer. &quot;I&#39;m not going to just let myself be at the bottom.&quot;

//&quot;I gave Denine a fair shot to see if we could work something out,&quot; Jennifer explains, &quot;but it&#39;s clear she&#39;s not interested. And I need a backup plan if the original Quibas people don&#39;t break. If you don&#39;t have your eye on the prize, then it will slip out of your fingers.&quot;//

$c[**Chalpe**]

Ashleia, Candace, and Jarrett are walking in the woods around camp, looking for dry brush.

&quot;There&#39;s no question, we have the others right where we want them,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;The old guard is voting Vaclav out with us. Buddy and Louie don&#39;t like each other, so as soon as Vaclav goes, we&#39;re breaking that truce. Let them at each other&#39;s throats.&quot;

&quot;So, we just pick off the other guys,&quot; says Candace.

&quot;That&#39;s the plan,&quot; Jarrett replies. &quot;We have no reason to trust them.&quot;

&quot;And you&#39;re not just pulling our legs like last time?&quot; Candace asks.

&quot;I have no reason to do anything like that,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;Saul was the outsider last time. This time it&#39;s Vaclav. That&#39;s the way we&#39;re voting.&quot;

&quot;Well if that&#39;s your final answer,&quot; says Candace, &quot;then I&#39;ll take you at your word.&quot;

//&quot;So, Jarrett wants Vaclav out,&quot; says Candace. &quot;That&#39;s fair. But if he says anything else after,&quot; she reaches into her pocket, &quot;then I&#39;m not listening.&quot; She pulls out a small bracelet made of wooden beads from her pocket. &quot;Idols don&#39;t tell lies.&quot;//

&quot;Should we, like, talk to the guys to make sure this happens?&quot; Ashleia asks.

&quot;Already done,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;Don&#39;t worry. It&#39;s not like he&#39;s going around helping matters, I only really see him with Louie.&quot;

&quot;You aren&#39;t worried that Louie might try to change things?&quot;

&quot;If he does, then he&#39;s just giving us a fourth ally in Buddy.&quot; Jarrett looks Ashleia in the eyes. &quot;We&#39;ll get out of this. I&#39;ve got this, you know I wouldn&#39;t put you in any danger.&quot;

//&quot;Ashleia is my go-to, she&#39;s still solid with me,&quot; explains Jarrett. &quot;I need to make sure she knows that. I would definitely go to bat for her if I heard her name come up, but right now the only name out there is the one I want to be out there. For everyone else, this is a test of whether I can trust them down the road, and that includes Candace.&quot;//

$q[**Quibas**]

Denine and Monty are sitting together. Monty is chewing on a blade of grass, while Denine uneasily twiddles her thumbs.

&quot;The nerve of people like Jennifer,&quot; says Denine. &quot;She thinks she has me for granted because we spent more than a week together. That makes me see everything that&#39;s wrong with them, more than anything. And her problem is all she talks about is game. I&#39;m not here for that.&quot;

Monty nods. &quot;You&#39;re right. It&#39;s why I don&#39;t get on with Jackie. Some people just think they&#39;re above everyone else. We&#39;re all human, and sometimes you have people like them who say it&#39;s not true, and that they&#39;re entitled to more than you just because that&#39;s the way they are.&quot; He spits into the dirt, and Denine recoils.

&quot;That&#39;s not why I&#39;m here. I love the whole experience,&quot; Denine adds. &quot;I&#39;m not all about numbers, this isn&#39;t math class.&quot;

//&quot;I didn&#39;t think anyone here would see things the same way I do,&quot; says Monty. &quot;I understand what Denise is talking about, just wanting to lay back a little. It&#39;s a once in a lifetime thing, so don&#39;t let the stress get you down.&quot;//

&quot;I just want to close my eyes and shut everything out,&quot; Denine admits. &quot;Sometimes it&#39;s too much.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not good to hide yourself away from the world,&quot; says Monty.

&quot;I know...&quot; Denine sighs. &quot;I&#39;m not trying to. But I&#39;m overwhelmed. Everything&#39;s moving too fast for my liking.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I get you. Sometimes these people are too uptight.&quot; Monty belches loudly.

&quot;Gross,&quot; Denine mutters.

&quot;What do you say about working with me and Paula?&quot; Monty asks.

&quot;I&#39;m all for that,&quot; says Denine. &quot;We&#39;re cool.&quot;

Monty smiles.

//&quot;Heck no, he&#39;s not a real ally,&quot; says Denine. &quot;He&#39;s boorish, he&#39;s disgusting, he just didn&#39;t get what I was saying at all. I don&#39;t really care if this puts me back to square one. I have standards.&quot;//

Paula is looking around in the bushes and trees, with Khall by her side.

&quot;Now, I know we&#39;ve made up and everything,&quot; says Paula, &quot;but what I&#39;m doing right now is none of Jackie&#39;s business and none of Monty&#39;s business.&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; says Khall. &quot;This is just for you, right?&quot;

&quot;If you touch it first, I promise it&#39;s yours,&quot; Paula replies.

//&quot;I need to make sure the two sides of our little group are repaired, so I decided to do a little trust building with Khall,&quot; Paula explains. &quot;He&#39;s sweet, and we get along. And I really don&#39;t mind if he finds the idol since I think he&#39;d use it correctly.&quot;//

&quot;So,&quot; says Khall, &quot;will it just be the four of us?&quot;

&quot;I hope it doesn&#39;t come to that,&quot; says Paula. &quot;I&#39;m still thinking. We should maybe be able to get Jennifer or Denine to our side, then we have the majority.&quot;

&quot;What about Rocky?&quot; Khall asks.

&quot;He&#39;s kind of a tool,&quot; Paula explains, &quot;and I think he&#39;s at the top of the girls&#39; lists. If for some reason Jackie decides to be an idiot, we&#39;re most likely to have the votes if we go against him.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think Jackie would do something stupid,&quot; says Khall. &quot;She&#39;s my friend.&quot;

&quot;That makes one of us.&quot; Paula reaches into a leafy bush and pulls out a rock. &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s impossible for her to think &#39;I&#39;m going to make a big move&#39; and backstab us. It would definitely put her on the bottom though. I&#39;m tired of her attitude.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m tired of you guys not being friends,&quot; Khall replies.

Paula comes out of the bush empty-handed. &quot;That&#39;s too bad. She&#39;s made her bed. She&#39;s just really lucky that we need her right now.&quot;

Immunity Challenge**

The two tribes arrive at the challenge beach to see fourteen poles arranged in two rows, each with a pair of rungs sticking out of the sides. Everyone is instructed to get onto a pole, with their feet on the rungs and their arms wrapped around the pole. If someone falls off their pole or touches the ground, they are out. First tribe to lose all of their members goes to tribal council. For each member remaining on the winning tribe, they receive three cups of beans.

Within five minutes of starting, Vincent begins talking to the contestants.

$v[&quot;Buddy, do you think you can do well at this challenge?&quot;]

&quot;I think so,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;This isn’t the first time I&#39;ve been in this sort of situation.&quot;

&quot;Yeah but last time you didn&#39;t have any clothes on,&quot; says Rocky.

Denine does a spit take, and in her laughing fit she loses her grip and falls backwards.

$v[&quot;Well, I guess Denine is out.&quot;]

&quot;Thank god, now I don&#39;t have to be first out,&quot; says Louie. He jumps off.

$v[&quot;Louie is down. Each tribe now has six. Jackie, how long do you think you can hold out?&quot;]

&quot;All the way, I&#39;m winning this challenge,&quot; Jackie replies.

$v[&quot;Rhett, what&#39;s your strategy here?&quot;]

&quot;I don&#39;t have one.&quot;

$v[&quot;Alright, then I&#39;ll be back later to see how you are doing.&quot;]

$t[//5 Minutes In//]

Jackie gets an idea, and tries to talk to the other tribe. &quot;Hey. Hey Vaclav.&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t make any deals with me, you can&#39;t give me anything I want,&quot; Vaclav replies.

&quot;Throw the challenge.&quot;

&quot;No!&quot;

&quot;He ain&#39;t gonna listen to you, sweetheart,&quot; says Monty.

&quot;I&#39;m not gonna listen to you either, Monty!&quot; Jackie snaps.

$t[//10 Minutes In//]

Candace is trembling on her pole.

&quot;This is so stupid...&quot; she mutters to herself.

&quot;You can do it, Candace,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;Try meditating or something.&quot;

&quot;I feel my legs are going numb,&quot; Candace replies. &quot;I can&#39;t zone out for more than ten seconds before the tingling sensation comes back.&quot;

&quot;It doesn&#39;t hurt, does it?&quot; Jarrett asks.

&quot;No, not yet,&quot; says Candace. She closes her eyes.

Rocky smirks. &quot;You are getting veeeery sleepy...&quot; he says gently.

&quot;Don&#39;t make me come over there,&quot; Jennifer snaps at him.

All of a sudden, Ashleia loses her footing and falls off.

$v[&quot;After ten minutes, Ashleia is down. Chalpe has five left.&quot;]

&quot;You can do it,&quot; Ashleia says to her team before heading over to where Denine and Louie are watching.

$t[//15 Minutes In//]

$v[&quot;We are fifteen minutes into the challenge, and eleven players are going strong.&quot;]

&quot;Not really,&quot; says Candace. &quot;I don&#39;t know if I can keep going.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re doing well so far,&quot; says Buddy.

&quot;No, I&#39;m not!&quot; Candace snaps. &quot;I&#39;m going to fall!&quot;

&quot;Then hurry up!&quot; Rocky yells.

&quot;Shut up, Rocky! I... crap!&quot; Candace falls off her pole, somewhat sideways.

$v[&quot;Candace is down! Quibas is advancing their lead.&quot;]

&quot;Oh god, I think I twisted something,&quot; Candace moans.

&quot;Are you okay! I&#39;ll help you!&quot; Khall jumps off his pole and races over to check on Candace.

&quot;Are you kidding me! You don&#39;t even //know// her!&quot; Jackie yells at Khall.

Jackie&#39;s sudden yelling startled Monty enough to make him twitch. He lost his grip and slid down the pole, feet slipping off the rungs and hitting the ground.

$v[&quot;Khall is down, and so is Monty! We are tied up again!&quot;]

$t[//25 Minutes In//]

$v[&quot;It&#39;s almost been half an hour,&quot;] says Vincent, $v[&quot;and we have four players remaining on each side. On Quibas we have Jackie, Jennifer, Paula, and Rocky. On Chalpe we have Buddy, Jarrett, Rhett, and Vaclav.&quot;]

Rocky is knocking his knees gently against the side of his pole.

&quot;Getting a little antsy?&quot; Buddy asks. &quot;Why don&#39;t you try and stretch for a bit?&quot;

&quot;Very funny,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;I&#39;m not dropping.&quot;

&quot;You look bored standing up here,&quot; Buddy adds.

&quot;Well, you look dumb!&quot; Rocky snaps.

&quot;Is that the best you&#39;ve got?&quot;

Rocky narrows his eyes and tightens his grip on the pole.

$t[//30 Minutes In//]

$v[&quot;It&#39;s been thirty minutes, and time for the next half of the challenge. You have ten seconds to wrap your legs around the pole. After that ten seconds, putting either foot back on the rungs means you&#39;re out. The countdown starts now.&quot;]

&quot;Oh damn,&quot; says Denine.

Most of the remaining players begin to lift their legs, but Jackie has completely lost feeling in hers and falls backwards.

Everyone else struggles to get into position, but soon the grace period is over.

$v[&quot;Jackie has fallen so she&#39;s out, and... Rhett still has one foot on the rungs. He&#39;s out.&quot;]

&quot;That wasn&#39;t ten seconds!&quot; Rhett complains.

$v[&quot;Yes, yes it was.&quot;]

Rhett mutters a swear while stepping down.

$t[//In the end...//]

After 40 minutes, Paula falls off her pole.

Five minutes pass until Jarrett steps down, and Buddy falls not long after him.

An hour after the beginning of the challenge, only Jennifer and Rocky remain for Quibas, and Vaclav for Chalpe.

$v[&quot;All three of you have been up there for sixty minutes.&quot;]

&quot;Hell yeah!&quot; Rocky shouts.

$v[&quot;Can you do it for ninety minutes?&quot;]

&quot;Hell yeah!&quot; Rocky shouts again.

After eighty minutes, one more contestant falls off.

$v[&quot;And Jennifer is down! We have one contestant left on each tribe, let&#39;s see how far they can last.&quot;]

Rocky gasps. &quot;No, we don&#39;t! Look at his shoes!&quot;

Vincent looks over to Vaclav&#39;s pole, and notices Vaclav&#39;s foot had slipped down and hit a rung.

Vaclav looks down and realizes he had made a big mistake. &quot;Oh no... I&#39;m so sorry, guys.&quot;

$v[&quot;Vaclav is disqualified, which means Rocky is the last one standing! Quibas wins immunity and three cups of beans!&quot;]

The new Chalpe is told to pick someone from Quibas to kidnap, and Louie picks Denine.

$c[**Chalpe**]

//&quot;I really thought we had it there,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;We were doing so well. But somehow Rocky won, and his smug little grin means he&#39;s never going to let any of us forget this. One of us is going home, and it&#39;s all his fault.&quot;//

Rhett is standing in a group with Jarrett, Candace, Buddy, and Ashleia.

&quot;We have five votes here,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;Buddy, Rhett, we can trust the two of you, right? Because I don&#39;t know what to think of Louie right now.&quot;

&quot;Forget Louie,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;He was garbage today.&quot;

&quot;Does that change our plans at all?&quot; Candace asks.

Jarrett shakes his head. &quot;The plan still is Vaclav. Anyone can stand still, doesn&#39;t really show much for strength. And once they get Rocky out that disadvantage doesn&#39;t mean anything.&quot;

&quot;Once they get Rocky out? What if they don&#39;t?&quot; Buddy asks.

&quot;I think they will,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;He was, like, really lucky. But now he has no allies over there.&quot;

&quot;Right, and Vaclav has none here,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;Louie&#39;s the one who got to kidnap someone, so she&#39;s probably protecting Louie instead.&quot;

//&quot;We should have a stable group here, but I don&#39;t want to split the votes,&quot; Jarrett explains. &quot;There aren&#39;t enough of us for me to be comfortable doing that.&quot;//

&quot;So, do we go and tell Louie he&#39;s safe?&quot; Rhett asks.

&quot;Might help, but that might give him the impression that he&#39;s on the outs,&quot; says Jarrett.

&quot;He IS on the outs,&quot; Buddy snaps. &quot;If anything, we&#39;re doing him a favour by not taking him out right now.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not going to happen with Denine here,&quot; says Jarrett.

Meanwhile, Vaclav is sitting in the shelter with Denine and Louie.

&quot;I&#39;m beside myself right now,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;They want me out, I know it! After I gave it my all today, it&#39;s worth nothing and they want me out. They all did, from the beginning!&quot;

Denine glances at Louie. &quot;Is he always this... pathetic?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want to go home like this! I haven&#39;t even done anything!&quot;

//&quot;I&#39;m not paranoid, I know what they&#39;re all thinking! They don&#39;t want me on their tribe, and that&#39;s been the case since I got there,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;I&#39;m just screwed because they just want an easy target. It sucks! I don&#39;t deserve to go home!&quot;//

&quot;You gotta help me out tonight!&quot; Vaclav asks. &quot;Please! There has to be something you can do.&quot;

&quot;If it involves interacting with people, forget it,&quot; says Louie.

Vaclav sighs, but harshly and shallowly because of how stressed he is. &quot;You don&#39;t even have to do that! Just watch them like I&#39;ve been doing! Do you see who&#39;s talking with whom? I know who the biggest threat here is, but because I&#39;m the target they won&#39;t do anything about it!&quot;

&quot;Now you have my attention,&quot; says Denine. &quot;You want us to help you kick the tribe in the nards?&quot;

&quot;The what!?&quot;

//&quot;It all comes down to tribal councils,&quot; says Louie. &quot;It may look like I don&#39;t really give a shit, but that&#39;s because I put my energy where it matters, at the voting booth. And if Vaclav leaving puts me at risk then I&#39;ll make sure they know I&#39;m not having it.&quot;//

A little later, Buddy is talking to Rhett when they run into Vaclav.

&quot;Hey Vaclav, I have a pitch for you,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;So, the Ochora people are morons and want to vote you out.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s obvious, isn&#39;t it?&quot; says Vaclav.

&quot;Well I&#39;m not up for that.&quot; Buddy crosses his arms. &quot;We&#39;re voting someone else.&quot;

&quot;Please tell me you&#39;re voting Jarrett,&quot; says Vaclav.

&quot;What? Of course not,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;I&#39;m putting Louie down. We have Ashleia, we just need you to tie it up.&quot;

&quot;Ummmm, okay,&quot; says Vaclav, nodding. &quot;I just don&#39;t want to leave.&quot;

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;We&#39;re going to trim the fat.&quot;

//&quot;Louie&#39;s kidnapping of Denine was totally expected, but ultimately useless,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;I hope they enjoy the next few hours of being miserable jerkoffs, because one of them won&#39;t be here tomorrow. He refused to bury the hatchet, so I&#39;ll bury HIM instead.&quot;//

$v[**Tribal Council**]

The new Chalpe tribe, and old Chalpe member Denine, walk into the tribal council building. They place their lit torches behind their seats.

$v[&quot;Welcome back. Let&#39;s start with Rhett. What was it like to learn that not only was one tribe broken up, but all of you were shuffled around to different camps?&quot;]

&quot;It&#39;s been tough,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;I felt like I was doing okay on this tribe before, and now there&#39;s more people to worry about and I don&#39;t feel as safe anymore.&quot;

$v[&quot;Buddy, you were being targeted heavily last time, do you think this swap came at a good time?&quot;]

&quot;I think it did, but it could have worked out better,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;The three that came here from Ochora are fairly close.&quot;

&quot;But we&#39;re willing to work with you,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;You&#39;re benefitting from this.&quot;

&quot;For now,&quot; says Vaclav.

$v[&quot;Vaclav, you have an opinion on this?&quot;]

&quot;Yes, I really do,&quot; Vaclav says. &quot;Jarrett&#39;s alliance wants me out. I could tell it from the very beginning, they saw me as someone that wouldn&#39;t put up a fight. Well they&#39;re dead wrong! I&#39;m not going to give up!&quot;

&quot;We didn&#39;t even say anything about you,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;If you want to know why you&#39;re on the chopping block, it&#39;s because you&#39;re volatile.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry for not being your little lap dog! I didn&#39;t //ask// to be in this position!&quot; Vaclav exclaims.

$v[&quot;What position are you talking about?&quot;]

&quot;I&#39;m the only one from my old tribe here,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;So, when I came here, there was three and three! With the kidnapping they don&#39;t need a fourth as a swing vote, so that makes me expendable! You all know it! And if I didn&#39;t say anything at all I would be as good as gone.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re just making it worse for yourself, actually,&quot; says Jarrett.

&quot;Okay both of you shut up,&quot; says Candace. &quot;I&#39;m getting a migraine.&quot;

$v[&quot;Louie, what does Vaclav being targeted mean for you?&quot;]

&quot;It means I&#39;m on a tribe full of dumbasses,&quot; says Louie, &quot;who think that they&#39;ve got the game all lined up. Guess what, not all of you can win.&quot;

&quot;The hell does that mean?&quot; Buddy asks, crossing his arms. &quot;Actually, no, don&#39;t say anything.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;d like that,&quot; says Denine, &quot;wouldn&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Vincent, I&#39;m not interested in playing their little high school games,&quot; Louie explains. &quot;Jarrett and his new clique might think they&#39;re all that and a bag of chips, but there&#39;s only so long that can take you.&quot;

Ashleia leans over to Jarrett. &quot;This kind of negativity is why we&#39;re voting him out,&quot; she whispers.

&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t think so,&quot; whispers Jarrett. &quot;Louie&#39;s a goat.&quot;

&quot;Your other goat won the challenge today,&quot; Ashleia replies. 

&quot;Got something to share with the class?&quot; Denine asks, turning to look at Ashleia.

&quot;I&#39;m, like, just saying that I&#39;m voting for Louie tonight,&quot; says Ashleia.

&quot;Well I&#39;m, like, just saying, like,&quot; Denine replies mockingly, &quot;good luck with that.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll see about that,&quot; says Buddy.

$v[&quot;I think this is as good a time as ever to start the voting,&quot;] says Vincent. $v[&quot;Buddy, you are up first.&quot;]

As Buddy stands up and walks to the voting booth, Jarrett looks over at Vaclav. &quot;You just dodged a serious bullet, you know.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t have to tell me twice,&quot; Vaclav replies.

...

Jarrett reveals his vote for Louie. &quot;You&#39;re so delusional that it&#39;s almost endearing. But then I remember how useless you are.&quot;

Louie reveals his vote for Jarrett. &quot;Well played, dumbass. Your days are numbered.&quot;

...

$v[&quot;Louie.&quot;]

Louie pretends to gasp in horror.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$v[&quot;Jarrett.&quot;]

Jarrett rolls his eyes.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$v[&quot;Louie. He leads with two.&quot;]

Ashleia bows her head down, but looks up at the votes being shown.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$v[&quot;Jarrett. We are tied.&quot;]

&quot;This is getting exciting,&quot; says Denine.

&quot;Easy for you to say,&quot; Louie snaps.

$v[&quot;Next vote... Jarrett.&quot;]

Vaclav adjusts his glasses.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$v[&quot;Louie. We are tied with three votes each.&quot;]

Candace takes a deep breath and brushes the hair out of her face.

&quot;You good?&quot; Buddy asks.

Candace nods quietly.

$v[&quot;The next vote...&quot;]
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$v[&quot;...is for Jarrett.&quot;]

&quot;What&#39;s going ooooon?&quot; Ashleia mutters.

Louie smirks.

$v[&quot;Fifth $boot is **Jarrett**. You need to bring me your torch.&quot;]

&quot;I appreciate it,&quot; says Jarrett sarcastically, as he gets up and walks towards his torch.

Vaclav sighs, and clutches his chest. Denine and Louie high five.

Jarrett puts his torch down in front of Vincent, looking peeved.

$v[&quot;Jarrett, the tribe has spoken.&quot;] Vincent extinguishes the basketball player&#39;s torch. $v[&quot;It&#39;s time for you to go.&quot;]

&quot;It&#39;s been real,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;Maybe too real. Go choke, Louie.&quot;

&quot;Get over yourself,&quot; Louie snaps, as Jarrett walks out of tribal.

$v[&quot;It&#39;s not smart to take everything you see at face value,&quot;] says Vincent. $v[&quot;Jarrett saw a stable alliance and an easy vote, and he got a knife in the back. Let his game be a reminder that Survivor guarantees nothing and waits for no one. You can head back to camp.&quot;]
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$c[&quot;I was taking out the threats for them, and this is how they repay me?&quot; Jarrett grimaces. &quot;Excuse me for having the balls to do what they couldn&#39;t. What&#39;s even worse than that is that I was betrayed when I decided to throw them a bone. I gave them an underhand pitch, and they beaned me in the head with the bat. Unbelievable.&quot;]

Voting Results:
**Jarrett - Candace, $q[Denine], Louie, Rhett, Vaclav**

&quot;Thank you so much, all of you,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;I was worried sick tonight, but I&#39;ll prove to you that this was the right decision.&quot;

&quot;It just made sense,&quot; Candace replies. &quot;It was just a gut feeling that voting him out was the right thing to do.&quot;

Ashleia&#39;s eyebrows raise in shock, and she looks over at Candace. &quot;When did you think that?&quot;

&quot;In the middle of one of his speeches,&quot; says Candace with a yawn. &quot;He kept going on about how Vaclav was &#39;volatile&#39;, but did he ever stick by anything when we were on Ochora?&quot;

&quot;Well, he-&quot; Ashleia begins.

&quot;He changed his mind on everything!&quot; Candace continues. &quot;He spared Rocky twice after saying he was dead meat, and he even flipped to Louie after everything he said. He could NOT be trusted.&quot;

//&quot;I don&#39;t care if we had the numbers,&quot; says Candace. &quot;I could not stand to have Jarrett here any longer. Maybe he was willing to work with me, but you know what? I can&#39;t forgive him.&quot;//

&quot;He thought he could get away with it because he was an athletic alpha male,&quot; Rhett adds, punching his right palm with his left hand. &quot;That&#39;s why he had to go! If we didn&#39;t take action tonight, he might have ended up with two idols or something.&quot;

&quot;He was a provider,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;We just lost some muscle.&quot;

&quot;Oh, now you care about who&#39;s helpful,&quot; says Denine.

&quot;I always did,&quot; Buddy snaps. &quot;And I still help out and pick up for everything Louie conveniently naps through! You don&#39;t even go here, Denine.&quot;

&quot;Cut it out,&quot; shouts Rhett. &quot;You&#39;re not even on the same tribe anymore, can you stop your arguing already? It&#39;s been a long night, some of us don&#39;t want to end it on a sour note, and you&#39;re doing a great job of making that happen!&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; says Buddy.

&quot;He said shut it,&quot; says Louie.

&quot;Louie!&quot; Rhett yells. &quot;You especially! Denine won&#39;t be here in the morning, but Buddy will, so suck it up and stop trying to get in the last word!&quot;

//&quot;These people are insane,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;I just don&#39;t understand with them. I&#39;m trying to play an intellectual game, but every time I turn around it&#39;s like we&#39;re in a sitcom. I&#39;m glad we voted out the producer favourite athlete hustler, but I wish it didn&#39;t mean listening to more of, well, that!&quot;//

$q[**Quibas**]

In the morning, dark clouds drift into the sky directly above camp, and the ground below becomes steadily darker. Some of the tribe, sitting in the shelter, notices this.

&quot;Think there&#39;s finally going to be some inclement weather?&quot; Jennifer asks.

&quot;Might just be,&quot; says Monty. &quot;Could be a storm coming on.&quot;

&quot;It would be perfect fishing weather,&quot; Jennifer replies. &quot;Well, good for the fish, anyways.&quot;

&quot;Then who&#39;s going to do the honours?&quot; Paula asks.

&quot;I think it should be Rocky,&quot; says Monty. &quot;He&#39;s looking for something to prove, ain&#39;t he?&quot;

&quot;That and if we can keep him away,&quot; says Jennifer, &quot;then we won&#39;t all be smelling wet skunk right away.&quot;

Paula grimaces. &quot;Thanks for the mental image,&quot; she says sarcastically.

//&quot;This Rocky kid, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s all bad,&quot; says Monty. &quot;He ain&#39;t lazy. He definitely could have turned out better if he got the belt every now and then, smarten him up a little.&quot;//

&quot;You know, we have the numbers to get rid of him if we want,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;Jackie, Khall, the three of us. That&#39;s more than enough. And Denine despises Rocky, so we can even split it if we want to.&quot;

&quot;I think we oughta keep it simple,&quot; Monty replies. &quot;The others won&#39;t be torn up to see Rocky gone. That&#39;s the way it&#39;ll be.&quot;

&quot;What if he has an idol?&quot; Paula asks. &quot;Or some other advantage?&quot;

&quot;If we keep Denine voting against Rocky we only need two votes against her,&quot; Jennifer explains. &quot;That would be five votes against Rocky, so he idols out Denine or he&#39;s a goner.&quot;

//&quot;We can&#39;t tie ourselves to the tribes we had before the swap,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;Especially if Denine isn&#39;t thrilled about working with me, I&#39;m not thrilled about giving her a second chance. Maybe if she didn&#39;t brush me off then I wouldn&#39;t be making her the decoy, but she did this to herself.&quot;//

Rocky comes into the shelter, and shortly afterwards they hear a low, thunderous rumble.

&quot;The fish are going to be really happy about the rain,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;Can you go and see if you can catch some before lightning strikes?&quot;

&quot;Why don&#39;t you do it?&quot; Rocky replies. &quot;They&#39;ll be even more attracted to your fish breath.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s no way to treat a lady, Rocky,&quot; Monty interjects.

&quot;&#39;Lady&#39;? Oh, come on now!&quot; Rocky folds his arms. &quot;That would mean I have some sort of respect for her. You&#39;d at least be entertaining if you took that stick out of your ass, Jen.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;d at least be more than a free boot if you pretended to be a good person,&quot; says Jennifer.

&quot;Your standard of &#39;good&#39; is a bad standard,&quot; Rocky counters. &quot;Trust me, I don&#39;t need to suck up to you to win.&quot;

&quot;Basic human decency is sucking up, now?&quot; Jennifer laughs. &quot;Idiot.&quot;

&quot;I think I&#39;ve made my point,&quot; says Rocky. He gets up and heads out of the shelter.

&quot;It&#39;s like he don&#39;t even realize what he&#39;s doing to himself,&quot; says Monty.

&quot;Sometimes you have to let someone shoot themselves in the foot,&quot; Paula replies.

//&quot;Jennifer thinks she&#39;s so much better than the rest of us,&quot; says Rocky, &quot;and I don&#39;t know why because I don&#39;t care about her. What I do know is that she&#39;s going to be one of many who finds out why you don&#39;t mess with the Rockster.&quot;//

$c[**Chalpe**]

Ashleia is sitting with Buddy in the shelter.

&quot;I just, like, I just don&#39;t get it,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;I thought the problem she had was with Jarrett&#39;s plans, not Jarrett himself. I wish I could have talked to her about it, you know?&quot;

&quot;We did talk to her, and she stabbed us in the back,&quot; Buddy replies. &quot;We&#39;ll probably end up losing again, then everyone will have to reconsider.&quot;

&quot;You still want Louie out more than anything?&quot; Ashleia asks.

&quot;Of course. He&#39;s worthless.&quot;

//&quot;I&#39;m not going to switch targets for the sake of it,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;I&#39;m sick of Louie wasting valuable space, and I want him out. If I have to, I&#39;ll vote differently, but I have no reason to flip yet.&quot;//

Meanwhile, Louie is lounging around on the dirt while Candace and Rhett talk next to him.

&quot;I just could not take his arrogance any longer,&quot; says Candace. &quot;I need to feel respected, and from him I didn&#39;t get that.&quot;

&quot;Jarrett was a tool,&quot; says Louie. &quot;And now he&#39;s gone. That&#39;s all that matters.&quot;

&quot;He got off easy,&quot; Candace snaps. &quot;I don&#39;t let people try and toy with me like that.&quot;

&quot;We all felt that way,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;Now we need to pick ourselves up and go forward.&quot;

&quot;Rhett&#39;s right,&quot; Louie adds, &quot;and there&#39;s nowhere for the weak links to hide.&quot;

//&quot;I wouldn&#39;t go as far as to call Louie an asset,&quot; says Candace. &quot;He&#39;s a crotchety old man... manlike creature. Give him an inch, he takes a mile, that sort of thing.&quot; She looks to the side, and scoffs.//

&quot;So who&#39;s next? Between Buddy, Ashleia, Vaclav, who can we lose?&quot; Louie asks.

&quot;I thought Vaclav was on your side,&quot; says Rhett.

&quot;Whatever.&quot; Louie pulls his visor down slightly. &quot;He was desperate so I told him what he wanted to hear. Does that mean we&#39;re best friends now? No, of course not.&quot;

&quot;No wonder you and Denine are so close,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;You&#39;re cut from the same cloth.&quot;

&quot;The total dick cloth,&quot; Candace adds.

&quot;I didn&#39;t ask for a psychoanalysis,&quot; Louie snaps. &quot;Do you want my vote or do you want to be the attitude police?&quot;

//&quot;Ask me who I want eliminated, and I&#39;ll tell you everyone,&quot; says Louie, matter-of-factly. &quot;In whatever order gets me to the end with some clown I can win against. They may not like me, but I&#39;m not the worst, and to keep me in that&#39;s all I really need.&quot;//

Meanwhile, a drizzle of rain begins coming down on the Chalpe camp. Slowly but surely it builds up to a heavier rain, until the rain is so intense that it&#39;s loud enough to make conversations difficult.

Vaclav is walking by himself, a little ways away from camp. He&#39;s wearing a grey coat that he&#39;s left undone, but when the rain begins falling he pulls it tighter around him.

A rodent of some kind darts out in front of him, crossing his path. Startled, Vaclav stumbles, before falling sideways into a bush of some kind.

//&quot;It would have been embarrassing if anyone saw me take that spill,&quot; says Vaclav, raising his voice to be heard over the rain. &quot;It&#39;s hard to see anything right now.&quot;//

While struggling to get up, his hand knocks against a package lying in the bush. Upon feeling it, he leans in closer, using his body to shield it from the downpour. He quickly recognizes the distinct circular shape, rips the paper packaging off, and reads the note attached.

&quot;//Congratulations, you have found the Chalpe Tribe&#39;s hidden immunity idol,// &quot;he reads. &quot;//This can be played at any tribal council before the votes are read, up until day 36. It will nullify all votes cast against a player of your choosing.// Oh my god. This is just what I needed right now.&quot;

He crumples the note in his hand and tucks it into his coat pocket. The other item in the packaging, a bracelet made with wooden beads held together with a light pink string, is slid onto his wrist, then tucked underneath his shirt sleeve.

&quot;I&#39;ve got to be subtle,&quot; he says to himself. He gets up from the bush and continues walking towards Town Square.

//&quot;I survived another day,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;I thought I was dead in the water, but something came through for me. Now I need to make sure that I can still have friends on both sides, just so that never ever ever happens again.&quot;//

$t[**Town Square**]

Vaclav is standing underneath a large leaf that he&#39;s using as a makeshift shelter. He wipes some rainwater off his glasses when he sees Paula and Monty approach from the Quibas camp.

&quot;Hey, you made it,&quot; says Monty.

&quot;And I was in the majority, too,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;So, things could be worse.&quot;

&quot;No, we meant if you would be able to sneak away from your tribe,&quot; says Paula.

Vaclav nods. &quot;In this weather. They might just think I got lost or something. I guess we should make this quick.&quot;

&quot;Alright. So, the four of us are still together,&quot; explains Paula. &quot;Jennifer and Denine don&#39;t like each other, and they both hate Rocky. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard about those three.&quot;

Vaclav nods. &quot;Denine saved me, and she likes Louie who likes me, so can you keep her around?&quot;

&quot;Yep, we&#39;re voting out Rocky,&quot; says Monty. &quot;He got no respect for no one.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m actually thinking we should put a few votes on Denine as a backup,&quot; Paula confesses.

Monty shakes his head. &quot;We don&#39;t need to make things too hard. Let&#39;s stick to the plan, y&#39;hear? Rocky has gotta go.&quot;

&quot;You think Rocky got an idol?&quot; Vaclav asks. &quot;Because if he doesn&#39;t, that&#39;s a stupid risk.&quot;

&quot;We have five solid people,&quot; says Paula. &quot;Keeping Jennifer is a no-brainer, and if something happens to you the four of us have to be stick together. If we lose, and kidnap you, we need you voting Rocky out.&quot;

//&quot;That first vote I really hated because of how little I knew about anyone,&quot; says Paula. &quot;But now I&#39;m getting a feel for everyone on my new tribe, and I can put the pieces together of what I want to do.&quot;//

&quot;Just make sure he&#39;s the one who goes if it&#39;s a tie,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;I can help you get Denine on our side.&quot;

&quot;You got it,&quot; says Paula. She smiles. &quot;I gotta get back before anyone realizes we went off together.&quot; She turns and runs towards her own tribe&#39;s camp.

&quot;We&#39;ll keep Denine safe if we can,&quot; Monty adds, &quot;if you can look out for Buddy, too.&quot;

&quot;Buddy?&quot; Vaclav adjusts his glasses. &quot;I don&#39;t know why him, but I guess I&#39;ll try.&quot;

Monty nods. &quot;Keep it together, Vaz.&quot; He turns around and walks in the same direction as Paula.

Immunity Challenge**

(if: $selected is 1)[Before the challenge begins, Vincent explains to Chalpe that the incident at camp yesterday ended up destroying the chaotic energy force inside Percival, who no longer has any memory of this series. It turns out his body was hijacked over a century ago, and the real Percival thinks television is black magic so we&#39;re not going to be seeing him again.

]Each tribe has an identical course. One after the other, contestants must climb through a tunnel made out of rope nets. They then immediately can start digging in a sand pit for a black ball; they do not have to wait for their tribemates to get through. The black balls, when found, are passed to a thrower, who needs to throw all five black balls into their tribe&#39;s baskets. First tribe to sink a ball into all five of their tribe&#39;s baskets wins immunity.

Order of climbing:
$c[Buddy, Vaclav, Candace, Rhett, Ashleia]
$q[Rocky, Jennifer, Paula, Khall, Jackie]
Throwers: $c[Louie], $q[Denine]
Sitting out: $q[Monty]

The challenge begins smoothly, with everyone getting through the rope net tunnel in turn.

Rocky finds a black ball first, then Buddy, then Paula.

Louie sinks his first basket before Denine but is left waiting for the other diggers.

Denine sinks a basket, then gets a ball from Jennifer.

Louie gets a ball from Rhett, but he is having more difficulty this time.

Denine sinks another ball in, then gets a ball from Jackie, leaving Khall as the last digger.

Louie then receives balls from Vaclav and Candace before either thrower sinks another basket.

Denine gets a third basket in, then Louie gets his second.

Ashleia hands over the last ball to Louie, who then scores his third.

Denine gets a fourth point and is forced to wait for Khall to find the last black ball.

Louie repeatedly misses the far two baskets.

Khall finally finds the last ball and hands it over to Denine.

Louie then scores the fourth and fifth baskets in quick succession.

$c[Chalpe wins immunity!]
$q[Quibas loses, and will be going to tribal council.]

Vincent instructs Quibas to kidnap someone from the opposing tribe, and they agree on Rhett.

$q[**Quibas**]

//&quot;It&#39;s not good to lose after being ahead for so long,&quot; says Monty. &quot;But we have a plan – vote Rocky out.&quot; He spits at the ground. &quot;That&#39;s all there is to it.&quot;//

The entire Quibas tribe, except with Rhett instead of Rocky, have a short meeting in front of the shelter.

&quot;We all know the plan, right?&quot; says Monty. &quot;We just vote Rocky out.&quot;

Jackie casts an annoyed glance to Paula.

Denine folds her arms. &quot;I&#39;d really like to believe you, Monty. But I can&#39;t.&quot;

Rhett looks over at her. &quot;Denine, it&#39;s what we&#39;ve been telling ourselves since we made the mistake of kidnapping him. You can&#39;t back out now.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not going to back out,&quot; Denine replies, pointing at the rest of her tribe. &quot;But the rest of you, I&#39;m not so sure about.&quot;

&quot;Can we not start something right now?&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;There isn&#39;t anything to discuss.&quot;

&quot;Not while I&#39;m here,&quot; Denine snaps. &quot;I&#39;m going to walk away, and you all are going to say, &#39;never mind, we&#39;re splitting the votes&#39;!&quot;

&quot;What the hell gave you that idea?&quot; asks Jackie.

&quot;Rocky did,&quot; says Denine. &quot;He said that once he goes, I&#39;m next, and I&#39;m not going to let that happen.&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t blame us for your own poor social game,&quot; says Paula.

//&quot;Denine has given me plenty of reason to not feel pity for her right now,&quot; Paula explains. &quot;I don&#39;t want to work with someone who throws a fit after losing the challenge, not while I have better options. At this point I might not be opposed to just blindsiding her and dealing with Rocky later.&quot;//

&quot;Poor social game? Are you kidding?&quot; Denine throws her arms up in the air. &quot;You don&#39;t even know what you&#39;re talking about! But fine, keep pretending you&#39;re all best friends, that will get you far when you see how many seats there are on day 39. Here&#39;s a hint, it&#39;s less than six!&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t need to get so hysterical,&quot; says Monty. &quot;We&#39;re not voting you. We&#39;re voting Rocky. Got it?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, okay,&quot; says Denine, &quot;and then we&#39;re all going out for ice cream!&quot;

&quot;Stop it,&quot; says Khall. &quot;I know you&#39;re upset, but don&#39;t get our hopes up.&quot;

Rhett looks Denine in the eyes. &quot;Denine... please, I think you need to take a minute and breathe.&quot;

Denine stops. &quot;Okay... yeah... this isn&#39;t worth fighting.&quot; She turns around but stops and looks back at the group. &quot;I&#39;ve heard enough. But if any one of you want to take this game seriously, you know who&#39;s ready to make a move.&quot; With a heavy sigh, Denine walks off.

//&quot;I could see through them like binoculars,&quot; says Denine. &quot;It&#39;s not like they could suggest anyone BUT Rocky when he&#39;s not there. I&#39;m not letting myself get tunnel vision on that smug little shitbird like the rest of them. I just need to wait for one of them to wake up to the garbage being put out.&quot;//

&quot;Oh no, she got us, what are we ever going to do?&quot; Jennifer rolls her eyes. &quot;Alright, how do we split it between them?&quot;

Rhett&#39;s eyes widen. &quot;Are you for real? I am not okay with this.&quot;

&quot;Fine, that&#39;s two votes for Rocky,&quot; says Paula. &quot;You and Monty. I&#39;ll vote Denine. Jackie, Khall, Jennifer, any preferences?&quot;

&quot;I have a preference,&quot; says Rhett, &quot;we vote Rocky out! Lord knows he deserves it!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think anyone really deserves it,&quot; says Monty.

//&quot;I don&#39;t believe it!&quot; Rhett grumbles. &quot;We have a perfect shot to get him out. He probably thinks we&#39;re playing it up to backstab someone else, and then bam, double blindside! Worst case, we flush out an idol and take him out later. There are only so many secret advantages one player can have! So why the cowardice from this tribe as well?!&quot;//

A little later, Jackie goes off by herself and meets up with Rocky again.

&quot;You should be good tonight,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;Denine&#39;s getting the boot tonight.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, about that, I changed my mind,&quot; says Rocky.

&quot;What do you mean changed your mind?&quot;

&quot;I mean what I said,&quot; Rocky replies.

The pair is quickly joined by Denine. &quot;Trying to rub your brain cells together to start a fire?&quot; she asks.

&quot;Boy, was that a contrived and unfunny remark,&quot; says Rocky.

&quot;Look, Denine,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;I&#39;m actually thinking of doing something. I am NOT a follower. I want to throw them off their game in the same way they did to me.&quot;

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s great,&quot; says Denine. &quot;Well, in that case, I want you to vote-&quot;

&quot;Stop,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;I&#39;m the one in charge here. If you get it wrong, then I&#39;m not flipping and one of you two is out. Understand?&quot;

//&quot;And suddenly I&#39;m the one who controls who leaves tonight,&quot; Jackie explains. &quot;It&#39;s fantastic. Either Denine guesses who I&#39;m thinking of, or I screw her and Rocky over. I&#39;ll tell Denine she picked correctly, so whichever way I flip will completely blindside the others. Sure, they may catch me, but not before it&#39;s too late and I&#39;ve gotten the result that I want.&quot;// 

$v[**Tribal Council**]

The Quibas tribe and Rhett walk into the tribal council building and place their torches behind the seats before sitting down.

Vincent clasps his hands together and looks over the losing tribe. $v[&quot;Immunity was down to the wire for you guys. Denine, as the thrower, do you feel responsible, that you failed to clinch the win for the tribe?&quot;]

Denine shakes her head. &quot;Oh, no way. I did my best, and despite what some people might try to say, I was giving it my all. I was just forced to wait for everyone else.&quot;
 
$v[&quot;Paula, no matter who&#39;s at fault, all of you are here and one of you is getting voted out. You have four people here from your old tribe out of seven voters, but you kidnapped Rhett.&quot;]

&quot;We did, he was something of a compromise pick,&quot; says Paula. &quot;We wanted to tell the new people on our tribe, &#39;hey, you&#39;re welcome here, we aren&#39;t going to just pick you off one by one&#39;. The best we can do together is tie it up, so the ball&#39;s really in their court.&quot;

$v[&quot;Rocky, are you getting that impression from your new tribe?&quot;]

&quot;You&#39;d have to be a special kind of stupid to fall for that,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;The so-called compromise pick is a lunatic who hates my guts. It&#39;s clear they&#39;re trying to kick me to the curb, just like Ochora said they would, but didn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;This time you&#39;ve done nothing to convince any of us to pull you out of that mess,&quot; says Jennifer.

&quot;I&#39;m not looking for your pity, Jennifer,&quot; Rocky snaps. &quot;If I go home because you&#39;re too weak to stand me, that&#39;s not going to break my heart. But just because I&#39;m not kissing your ass doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m giving up.&quot;

$v[&quot;Monty, it sounds like the tribe has rallied together against a common enemy.&quot;]

&quot;And it&#39;s Rocky,&quot; says Monty. &quot;It ain&#39;t Jackie, or Denine, or Jennifer, or Khall. The tribe, we came up with a plan, and we&#39;re gonna stick to it.&quot;

Jackie rolls her eyes, and shakes her head slightly.

Jennifer leans to one side and whispers something to Paula, who listens intently.

&quot;Got something to share with the class?&quot; Denine asks, folding her arms.

&quot;Of course not, they&#39;re cowards,&quot; says Rocky.

&quot;Cowardly would be not taking a stand,&quot; says Rhett, while Paula is whispering back to Jennifer, &quot;and taking a stand is what we&#39;re doing.&quot;

Jennifer then whispers something to Rhett. Paula gets out of her seat and whispers something to Jackie.

&quot;Um, what in the fresh hell is this?&quot; Rocky snaps. &quot;Is this allowed?&quot;

&quot;Hell yeah it is,&quot; says Jennifer.

$v[&quot;Khall, what do you make of this? You&#39;re seeing first-hand, the game never stops, and a round isn&#39;t over until the torch goes out.&quot;]

&quot;It&#39;s kind of confusing,&quot; Khall replies. &quot;Most of the time you have a plan going in, but if you&#39;re not talking to everyone else, and things change without you knowing, all you have is old information and a gut feeling.&quot;

Paula nudges Khall with her elbow, and whispers something to him. Jennifer and Jackie have a short and quiet exchange, and Rhett whispers something to Monty.

&quot;They just can&#39;t make it any more obvious what&#39;s actually going on,&quot; says Denine. &quot;They&#39;re nervous as hell. They want an out. They don&#39;t give a damn what I think, I&#39;m just next in the pecking order.&quot;

&quot;Now, that ain&#39;t true,&quot; says Monty. &quot;We&#39;re all voting the same. We all agreed on Rocky.&quot;

Rocky smirks.

Jackie whispers something to Denine, Rhett whispers to Paula, and Khall whispers something to Jennifer.

Jennifer immediately turns to face Khall. &quot;Khall, cut it out. You can&#39;t just say &#39;secret&#39; in my ear over and over.&quot;

&quot;I just wanted to feel included,&quot; says Khall.

&quot;You //are// included, you&#39;re part of the plan,&quot; says Paula.

After a few more hushed exchanges between everyone except Denine, Rocky, and Monty, the tribe settles back down into their seats.

&quot;I think we&#39;re ready,&quot; says Jennifer.

$v[&quot;Alright, with that in mind, Rhett. Do you want to give up your immunity?&quot;]

&quot;I would never do that,&quot; says Rhett.

$v[&quot;Okay, then it&#39;s time to vote. Jennifer, you&#39;re up first.&quot;]

Khall leans over to Jackie. &quot;Wait, are we voting together, or no?&quot;

Jackie brings her hand to her face. &quot;Oh. My. God.&quot;

...

Monty reveals his vote for Rocky. &quot;Just part of the plan. You shoulda been kinder.&quot;

Paula reveals her vote for Denine. &quot;It&#39;s nothing personal, so stop acting like we&#39;re out to get you.&quot;

...

$votesarein
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$v[&quot;First vote is for Rocky.&quot;]

Rocky tilts his head down, and glares over the rims of his shades.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$v[&quot;Denine. One vote Rocky, one vote Denine.&quot;]

&quot;See what I mean?&quot; says Denine, irritated.

&quot;That wasn&#39;t even us, that was Rocky,&quot; says Paula.

$v[&quot;Third vote... Denine.&quot;]

&quot;So Rocky voted twice?&quot; Denine says. &quot;Amazing!&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$v[&quot;Rocky.&quot;]

Rhett glances back and forth between the members of the opposing tribe.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$v[&quot;Next vote... Monty. One vote Monty, two votes Denine, two votes Rocky.&quot;]

&quot;Seriously, Jackie?&quot; Paula glares at Jackie. &quot;Now is not the time to- oh wait, that&#39;s not even your handwriting.&quot;

&quot;You thought I was going to just play into your hands?&quot; Denine snaps. &quot;That&#39;s a shame.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$v[&quot;Monty. We are tied. Two votes left.&quot;]

Monty shakes his head in disappointment.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$v[&quot;Seventh vote... is for Monty.&quot;]

&quot;Now //that// is my handwriting,&quot; says Jackie.

Jennifer&#39;s head whips around to look Jackie directly in the eyes. &quot;What the fuck?&quot;

Khall&#39;s eyes widen. &quot;Uh oh.&quot;

$v[&quot;Final vote, and the sixth $boot is **Monty**. You need to bring me your torch.&quot;]

&quot;Well, I did my best.&quot; Monty gets up. &quot;Jackie,&quot; he pauses to spit, &quot;karma&#39;s a not very nice lady.&quot;

&quot;Get outta here, Gramps,&quot; says Rocky.

Monty places his torch in front of Vincent, while Paula gives Jackie a death glare behind his back.

$v[&quot;Monty, the tribe has spoken.&quot;] Vincent snuffs the older man&#39;s torch. $v[&quot;It&#39;s time for you to go.&quot;]

&quot;We&#39;ll get her back,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;Take care, sir.&quot;

&quot;Same to you,&quot; says Monty. &quot;And be kind to each other.&quot; He walks out of the tribal council building.

Rocky opens his mouth, but Paula cuts him off. &quot;I think you&#39;ve said enough tonight, Rocky.&quot;

$v[&quot;Everyone has their own idea of who they can trust and who they can lose, and that&#39;s what makes alliances,&quot;] says Vincent, $v[&quot;but there&#39;s always more than one person who would benefit from switching things up. You can head back to camp.&quot;]
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$q[&quot;I had a good time out here,&quot; says Monty. &quot;When it comes to regrets, I don&#39;t have none. My friends I made here want to play the game, so I wish them luck.&quot;]

Reward Challenge**

The two tribes arrive at the challenge beach in the pouring rain, but Vincent says the show must go on, so they will be competing in the rain.

On the far end of a pool of water about 20 meters long is a pair of two platforms. Contestants must climb a ladder, and smash a tile hanging in front of them with a wooden baton to release a key. They must then swim back with the key and tag in the next person. There are five keys per tribe. Once all keys are returned, the final player must use all five keys to open a locked chest and use the letter tiles inside to spell out a phrase. First tribe to spell out the phrase wins two egg-laying chickens and a rooster.

Word Unscramblers: $c[Rhett], $q[Khall]
Sitting out: $q[Paula]

Both teams send out strong swimmers first: Louie for Chalpe and Jennifer for Quibas.

Louie is much faster than Jennifer but struggles with getting onto the ladder. When Jennifer reaches the ladder, she passes him easily.

Both Jennifer and Louie smash their tiles, but Jennifer makes it back with a key long before Louie does.

Monty is tagged in and is halfway to the platform when Louie tags in Candace.

Monty misses on his first attempt and has to go back up the ladder.

Candace climbs up and smashes her tile.

Monty smashes his tile the second time, but Candace has already made it back with her key.

Candace tags in Vaclav.

Monty makes it back with the second key when Vaclav smashes the third tile.

Rocky dives in for Quibas and reaches the ladder just after Vaclav gets back to the other end of the pool.

Ashleia jumps in but is not fast enough to catch in Rocky. Rocky smashes a tile and brings back a key before Ashleia is finished climbing the ladder.

While Rocky is tagging in Denine, Ashleia jumps and smashes the fourth tile for Chalpe.

Denine makes it to the ladder, and she is climbing when Ashleia tags in Buddy.

Denine smashes the fourth tile for Quibas while Buddy is halfway to the ladder, and she has returned with her key when Buddy reaches the top of the ladder.

Jackie is the last player to jump into the pool. Buddy smashes his tile, but when he jumps in, the splash sends the key floating to his side.

Buddy&#39;s scrambling to find the key floating nearby gives Jackie a chance to help close the gap.

When Buddy finds his key and grabs it, Jackie is climbing the ladder. She jumps and smashes her tile just before Buddy makes it back.

Buddy puts down the last key, and Rhett runs all five keys to Chalpe&#39;s locked chest. He sees three locks on both chests, meaning two keys don&#39;t work in any lock.

Jackie returns with her tribe&#39;s last key while Rhett is trying to open the first lock. He is trying one key at a time on the locks.

Khall gets to work on his chest, sticking one key in the first lock right as Rhett opens the first lock. Khall tries to put each key in all three locks before putting it down.

Khall&#39;s strategy helps him make up a bit of time. When Rhett has opened the final lock, he is working on the locks with his third key.

Rhett opens his chest and takes out 20 letter tiles. //S T O A R O U Y E T R O L O T E U H D Y//

Khall opens his chest shortly afterwards, finding the same 20 tiles. 

The puzzle solvers work for a few minutes, trying to figure out what they can spell in the word lengths provided.

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Eventually, one puzzle solver speaks up and calls Vincent over.

**STORY THE LORE UOU TODAY**

$v[&quot;Khall thinks he has it... and he&#39;s dead wrong!&quot;]

&quot;What!?&quot; Jackie cries out.

Rhett then calls Vincent over and shows what he thinks the answer is.

**TODAY YOU RULE THE ROOST**

$c[Chalpe wins reward!]
$q[Quibas loses, and returns to camp with nothing.]

$c[**Chalpe**]

The Chalpe tribe arrives back at camp, and they see a huge cage with three chickens inside on the ground near their shelter. Vaclav notices a piece of paper taped to the back of the cage, and swiftly removes it and puts it in his pocket while everyone else looks at the birds.

&quot;I&#39;m really glad we won this one,&quot; says Rhett, placing his hand on top of the cage. &quot;Lots of protein. We&#39;re going to need it.&quot;

&quot;How do we know which one&#39;s the rooster?&quot; Ashleia asks. &quot;That one won&#39;t lay eggs.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s the one that doesn&#39;t look like the other two,&quot; Louie replies.

&quot;It looks like the rain will come back soon,&quot; says Buddy. It had stopped shortly after the challenge was over. &quot;Might not be wise to try and get the fire going.&quot;

//&quot;We finally won a challenge, and I&#39;m ready to celebrate,&quot; says Candace. Her expression changes to show her irritation. &quot;But no, the rain is back, so we can&#39;t get a fire going to cook the damn chicken. Do you know how much I want some chicken? I can&#39;t live off plants, I&#39;m not a vegan!&quot;//

&quot;Let&#39;s bring the cage into the shelter,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;We can&#39;t let them get wet.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re birds, they&#39;ll be fine,&quot; says Louie.

&quot;They&#39;re chickens, not ducks,&quot; Vaclav replies. &quot;If we&#39;re going to cook them, why should they suffer in the cold first?&quot;

&quot;Ducks should suffer in the cold?&quot; Ashleia looks confused.

Buddy picks up the chicken cage and hauls it into the shelter by himself.

&quot;Now there are going to be feathers everywhere,&quot; Louie groans.

&quot;There&#39;s already fur that&#39;s been shed everywhere,&quot; Candace snaps. &quot;It shouldn&#39;t be a surprise where that came from. We&#39;ll live, Louie.&quot;

&quot;You sound upset,&quot; says Vaclav.

&quot;Hell yeah I&#39;m upset,&quot; says Candace. &quot;I just want some chicken!&quot;

//&quot;Candace is my friend,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;She&#39;s been with me for a while, and I trust her to at least mean the right thing. So seeing her frustrated like this has me really worried. I&#39;m just... not ready to lose another ally. I hope she can calm down.&quot;//

&quot;I think I just felt a rain drop,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;We should head under the tarp.&quot;

Buddy sighs. &quot;You know what I wish we got as a reward?&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; Louie asks.

&quot;Towels.&quot;

As if in response to Buddy&#39;s remark, the rain starts coming down much, much harder.

&quot;Don&#39;t jinx the storm or anything,&quot; says Rhett, already sitting inside the shelter.

(if: $selected is 1)[Before Buddy and Candace can get in the shelter with the others, an unfamiliar voice booms over the sounds of the rain.

(colour: green + blue + blue)[**&quot;Stay right where you are!&quot;**]

&quot;No thank you!&quot; Buddy darts into the shelter.

The chickens start sounding more agitated. Rhett flips open a door at the top and tries petting the birds to calm them down.

&quot;Oh, you are so brave,&quot; says Ashleia.

&quot;This isn&#39;t my first time around chickens,&quot; Rhett replies. &quot;When you&#39;ve lived in a rural area as long as I have-&quot;

(colour: green + blue + blue)[**&quot;Nobody cares about your backstory! I guess you guys want to be difficult...&quot;**]

There is a bright flash of cyan light, that gives way to a slender figure. Biped, but resembling a blue fox in facial structure and fur, some members of the tribe immediately recognized him.

Ashleia gasps. &quot;OMG. It&#39;s... it&#39;s... who is this again?&quot;

(colour: green + blue + blue)[&quot;Excuse me? Who am //I//? This is MY show.&quot;]

&quot;Oh, it&#39;s Percival,&quot; says Rhett.

&quot;Season one&#39;s overpowered, unlikable dumbass,&quot; says Louie. &quot;The fuck you want?&quot;

(colour: green + blue + blue)[&quot;Just checking in. You guys look like some of you could use my help.&quot;] Percival snickers. (colour: green + blue + blue)[&quot;Don&#39;t forget that I know what makes all of you tick.&quot;]

&quot;Prove it,&quot; Buddy snaps.

(colour: green + blue + blue)[&quot;Of course you want to try and pick a fight, Buddy. Give it a rest, no matter how tough you look you&#39;ll never be man enough for yourself.&quot;]

&quot;The hell does that mean?&quot; Buddy nearly shouts. &quot;You- you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t even acknowledge him,&quot; says Louie. &quot;He leeches off emotion.&quot;

(colour: green + blue + blue)[&quot;The same way you leech off your friends now? It&#39;s your own fault you&#39;re not an athlete anymore. You peaked at the ripe age of 21.&quot;]

Louie growls.

(colour: green + blue + blue)[&quot;I&#39;ve proved enough, haven&#39;t I? Well, then let&#39;s get to what I&#39;m here for. You-&quot;]

Out of nowhere, Percival winces and drops to the ground. He struggles to stand up, holding his shin, glaring at the person who just kicked him.

&quot;Shut up and leave us alone, dirtbag!&quot; Candace yells.

Percival glares at her. (colour: green + blue + blue)[&quot;Sneaky bitch, getting me with my guard down! You could chill out, you know. Maybe with an... e-cigarette?&quot;] He grins.

&quot;DON&#39;T YOU DARE TEMPT ME,&quot; Candace yells back. In the heavy rain, she hardly notices Rhett fiddling with the chicken cage.

(colour: green + blue + blue)[&quot;Just a quick puff or two. It doesn&#39;t have any drugs in it, you know better than that. What harm could it do?&quot;]

Candace continues to glare at Percival, letting some of her drenched hair lie over her face.

&quot;Hey, foxface! Think fast!&quot;

Percival barely has time to turn his head slightly when a mess of distressed feathers hits him in the face.

(colour: green + blue + blue)[&quot;Wha- hey! What&#39;s your problem!?&quot;] Percival snaps, during an embarrassingly short struggle against the tribe&#39;s newly-won rooster. He stumbles back, trips over a tree stump, and falls backwards onto a grassy slope. Slicked with rain, Percival can&#39;t stand up, and keeps on sliding to the bottom of the hill.

Buddy looks at Rhett. &quot;Did you just throw the rooster at him?&quot;

&quot;I had to,&quot; Rhett replies.

&quot;WHY!?&quot; Buddy yells, but it&#39;s drowned out by an even louder sound and a crackle of lightning.

Candace looks at the bottom of the hill for a second, and jumps into the shelter. &quot;He just got struck by fucking lightning.&quot;

Ashleia&#39;s jaw drops. The rest of the tribe is disturbed by Candace&#39;s statement, except for one.

&quot;Great teamwork, let&#39;s hope that&#39;s the end of his BS,&quot; says Louie.

&quot;Should we do something?&quot; Vaclav asks. &quot;Call the medic?&quot;

Louie makes a //don&#39;t worry about it// hand gesture. &quot;I&#39;m not going back out in this weather.&quot;

$q[**Quibas**]

&quot;You know, I totally forgot about that Percival guy,&quot; says Khall to nobody in particular. He is standing alone, doing nothing. &quot;But it sounds like the malevolent spirit inside him was just vanquished. All&#39;s well that ends well, I suppose.&quot;

Denine, who is sitting nearby, looks concerned for Khall&#39;s mental well-being for a brief moment.](elseif: $selected is 2)[$q[**Quibas**]

Denine is sitting by the firepit. The rain has let up for now, and she is watching Khall mumble something to himself.] She then speaks up.

&quot;You&#39;re not mad at me, right?&quot; Denine asks.

&quot;Why would I be?&quot; Khall replies. &quot;Have you done anything to me that I should know about?&quot;

&quot;If I had, why would I warn you?&quot; says Denine with a cold expression on her face. &quot;I just know that your old teammates put in a good word for you, but I haven&#39;t seen them talk to you lately.&quot;

&quot;Sometimes I just need my space,&quot; says Khall. &quot;And with Vaclav on the other tribe, I have to focus a lot more on keeping the latrine wormhole-free.&quot;

&quot;Oy, not this again.&quot;

//&quot;Don&#39;t mistake a lack of enthusiasm for a lack of effort,&quot; Denine explains. &quot;When nobody else is around, I&#39;m open to talk, provided it isn&#39;t about anything stupid. I want my tribemates to think I have their back, but one on one. I may backstab their allies, but I would never backstab them in particular. Of course, that&#39;s not true and will never be true.&quot;//

&quot;I was just confused that if they weren&#39;t taking with you, why wouldn&#39;t you talk with anyone else?&quot; Denine asks.

Khall shrugs. &quot;I guess I just forgot. Nothing against you, but right now we aren&#39;t exactly involved in each others&#39; plotlines.&quot;

Denine refuses to acknowledge his answer. &quot;Would you tell me if my name came up?&quot;

&quot;I think so, probably,&quot; says Khall. &quot;Unless I forget, which is possible. Right now, I think the plan&#39;s still Rocky.&quot;

&quot;And I&#39;ve checked his belongings,&quot; adds Denine, &quot;and he has no advantages to speak of. This should be easy. You think we can throw the challenge and just get it over with?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just worried that if we keep taking out Ochora we&#39;ll find ourselves in a stalemate at the merge,&quot; says Khall. &quot;And you might be loyal to us here, but when you&#39;re reunited with Louie then it&#39;s up in the air.&quot;

&quot;I like Louie, but I&#39;m not saying that I want him at the end,&quot; says Denine.

Khall looks behind Denine. &quot;What do you think? Can we believe her?&quot;

The person who had just arrived, from behind Denine, spits on the ground before rubbing the spit into the dirt with his shoe.

Denine turns her head around and her jaw drops.

&quot;Khall,&quot; she says angrily, &quot;why the //fuck// didn&#39;t you warn me?&quot;

Rocky smirks. &quot;It&#39;s not like I don&#39;t already know, princess. Just wait until the rest of the tribe hears about your little sabotage plan.&quot; He turns around, sprints off, and is out of sight before Denine could even get up, let alone catch him.

&quot;Good, now I&#39;m doomed,&quot; says Denine.

&quot;Unless you have an idol,&quot; Khall chimes in.

&quot;Why would I root through his stuff if I had one!?&quot;

&quot;If you did, why would you warn me?&quot; Khall grins from ear to ear, or at least his eyes give off that impression.

Elsewhere, Jackie is climbing up a trail by herself.

//&quot;So, the plan right now is just to vote Rocky out,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;But is it going to be that easy? I don&#39;t think so. And if something changes, I want to be a part of that and not be left out of the loop for a third time. I&#39;m so much better of a player than what you&#39;ve seen so far.&quot;//

She encounters Rocky, stops, and taps him on the shoulder.

&quot;I can see you,&quot; says Rocky, &quot;you didn&#39;t need to do that.&quot;

&quot;Well, none of us can see your eyes behind those unfashionable shades,&quot; says Jackie.

&quot;You don&#39;t know anything about style,&quot; Rocky replies. &quot;You won&#39;t find a pair better than these.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not important,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;I&#39;m not sure if you realize but everyone really wants you out right now.&quot;

&quot;Of course, I know that!&quot; Rocky snaps. &quot;But not everyone. I was just talking to Denine earlier and she told me the craziest thing.&quot;

//&quot;Nobody ever just gets out of the way because they realize how much more awesome I am than them,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;But I don&#39;t pick fights I can&#39;t win. And to win this fight, I need to stoop down to their level.&quot;//

&quot;She wants to throw the challenge,&quot; says Rocky.

&quot;I should have known,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;She&#39;s so ungrateful that she&#39;s on the winning tribe now. If she&#39;s so concerned about saving her friends, then maybe she could go in her place!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;d do that?&quot; Rocky asks.

&quot;What, and wait for her to throw it again once she hates someone as much as you?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the crazy part,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;She thinks your old tribe is the biggest threat. She couldn&#39;t get Vaclav out, so now she wants to cut the head off the snake.&quot;

&quot;That scheming little bitch!&quot; Jackie scowls. &quot;If she even //dares// to throw us off our game, she is done for!&quot;

//&quot;So Denine wants to stab me in the back? After all we&#39;ve done for her!?&quot; Jackie opens her mouth with a look of pure disdain but stays silent for a second. &quot;Well, unlike her, I have an alliance, and they&#39;re all going to know how much of a traitor she is.&quot;//

$c[**Chalpe**]

The tribe decided to take advantage of the dry period to get a fire started.

(if: $selected is 1)[&quot;I&#39;m glad we at least found the rooster after all of that,&quot; says Louie. &quot;Shame we couldn&#39;t just cook up our unexpected visitor.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re seriously disturbed,&quot; Buddy replies.

]&quot;Well, let&#39;s try to get the rooster cooked,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;Nothing else we can do with him. We&#39;re on Survivor, not Chick Raising Simulator.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t wait, seriously,&quot; says Candace. &quot;It&#39;s been so long since we had anything substantial.&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t you get a bread reward at one point?&quot; asks Buddy.

&quot;It was just that. Bread. Nothing else,&quot; Candace replies. &quot;We haven&#39;t gotten to the good rewards yet.&quot;

While the rest of the tribe chat, Ashleia steps aside with Vaclav.

&quot;Okay, like, I just have to say. I&#39;m really sorry for the way Jarrett treated you,&quot; Ashleia says.

Vaclav nods. &quot;You didn&#39;t do anything. That was his fault. He&#39;s gone now.&quot;

&quot;I still didn&#39;t vote with you,&quot; replies Ashleia. &quot;I should have known when you said his name.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s fine. As long as you don&#39;t want me out again.&quot; Vaclav sighs.

//&quot;I feel so alone right now,&quot; Ashleia explains. &quot;Just when I thought that I actually had some people on my side, everyone just lied to me and took out one of the only guys I&#39;ve trusted.&quot; She sniffles. &quot;I need to do something to make sure I&#39;m not next and stuff.&quot;//

&quot;Please don&#39;t be upset,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;Like, I know where I stand right now. I know that I might be in danger because I didn&#39;t vote with you. If I was you I would probably want to keep Buddy over me.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asks Vaclav. &quot;I don&#39;t get it.&quot;

&quot;Just because, like, I can tell you&#39;re a nice guy.&quot; Ashleia wipes her eyes with one hand. &quot;And if it comes down to it, I don&#39;t want it to be unanimous. I&#39;m asking you to cast, like, a stray vote. Can you do that for me?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, of course,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;Don&#39;t vote me. I won&#39;t vote you.&quot;

//&quot;Ashleia is not on my radar,&quot; Vaclav explains. &quot;I&#39;m actually kind of worried as to why she would ask me that. I haven&#39;t heard her name at all, so... oh are they just not talking to me now? They&#39;re going to keep Buddy and Louie, and Ashleia&#39;s making sure I can&#39;t idol her out. I just got it yesterday, how could they know I have it?&quot;//

After Ashleia left, Vaclav stays by himself, glancing over the paper he snagged from the chicken cage. &quot;Congratulations, you have found a clue to the- no way.&quot; Vaclav freezes. &quot;It&#39;s the idol clue to the idol I have. Nobody can see this.&quot;

&quot;Hey, Vaclav!&quot;

Vaclav blinks, shoves the idol clue in his mouth, and turns around quickly to see Rhett approaching.

&quot;The chicken&#39;s almost ready,&quot; says Rhett.

Vaclav nods, trying to inconspicuously hide the clue with his tongue. &quot;I&#39;ll be there in a minute.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay, I can wait. Say, have you noticed there haven&#39;t been any idol clues or anything?&quot; Rhett asks.

Vaclav winces. &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s... really weird.&quot;

&quot;It makes me think that the idol situation isn&#39;t what it seems,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;I think they aren&#39;t giving any clues. The production is just planting idols on people they want to get far. They&#39;ve done it before, right? That must be why Rocky&#39;s still in, they&#39;re feeding him insider knowledge and other advantages.&quot;

&quot;Wh-what would make you think that?&quot; Vaclav asks, trying to gently chew the clue.

&quot;Think about it! He&#39;s strong, abrasive, he makes good TV! He&#39;s the network&#39;s wet dream!&quot; Rhett stretches his arms out for emphasis. &quot;And did you notice how well he did on the last challenge, just to make sure he wouldn&#39;t get screwed by the swap? It&#39;s fishy, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

Vaclav nods, closes his eyes, and swallows the clue.

Rhett notices the unpleasant face Vaclav makes as he does this. &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s awful to think about. Where&#39;s the integrity of these people?&quot;

//&quot;It&#39;s settled,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;I have to get rid of Rocky. It&#39;s going to be tough since we&#39;re not on the same tribe, and I&#39;m running out of time before the jury starts, but it&#39;s the right thing to do. Then we can finally play the game it&#39;s meant to be played - without a producer&#39;s pet!&quot;//

$q[**Quibas**]

&quot;He looked me dead in the eye and he swore up and down! Denine is not with us!&quot; Jackie exclaims.

Her alliance looks at her, then shares glances between themselves.

&quot;And now we have the idol problem solved for sure,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;We split the vote.&quot;

&quot;We need to make sure it&#39;s one of us who kidnaps someone,&quot; says Paula. &quot;We need to have six solid votes. Three on Rocky, three on Denine.&quot;

Monty shakes his head. &quot;I don&#39;t like the sound of this. We had a good thing going, why not just stick to the plan?&quot;

&quot;This is the plan, now,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;So, like, time to put up or shut up.&quot;

//&quot;I was always afraid of this,&quot; Monty explains. &quot;I don&#39;t have V here anymore, and I think without him Paula is starting to go with her fellow girls. I don&#39;t want Paula to make things complicated and set herself up for failure. She&#39;s too smart for that.&quot;//

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but it&#39;s the way it has to be,&quot; Paula explains. &quot;The other option is to have faith that Rocky would go after Denine. I really don&#39;t like those odds. Just vote Rocky like you planned to, the rest of us will sort out who goes where.&quot;

&quot;And we need to do it offscreen,&quot; says Khall. &quot;Unspoken Plan Guarantee, after all; complicated plans are only laid out to the audience if they&#39;re supposed to see them fail.&quot;

&quot;We can&#39;t really control editing tricks out here,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;All we can do is be clear and communicate.&quot;

Meanwhile, Rocky is having a similar conversation with Denine.

&quot;Now listen here, woman,&quot; says Rocky.

&quot;Someone&#39;s feeling gentlemanly,&quot; says Denine.

&quot;Would you prefer &#39;bitch&#39;?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d prefer you drop dead.&quot;

&quot;I told Jackie you&#39;re throwing the challenge to vote her out,&quot; says Rocky.

&quot;What!? Why would I go against her?&quot; Denine snaps.

&quot;Old Quibas is five strong,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;So is your old tribe but you hate each other, clearly. They&#39;re the threat, and Jackie thinks she&#39;s the biggest one.&quot;

&quot;You think she just took that without questioning everything I&#39;ve said about you?&quot; asks Denine.

&quot;I didn&#39;t have any other choice,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;If you thought I&#39;d just let myself get sacrificed then you&#39;re dumber than she is.&quot;

Denine glares. &quot;So what do you want?&quot;

&quot;Well, new ally,&quot; says Rocky, &quot;we&#39;re on the bottom together, and we need each other. With any luck, they&#39;ll get cocky and try to split the vote.&quot;

&quot;The majority of them still want you out way more than me,&quot; says Denine. &quot;They don&#39;t have any reason to-&quot;

&quot;Shhhhhhhhh...&quot; Rocky pulls something out of his pocket and places it against Denine&#39;s lips. It&#39;s a small bracelet, made of wooden beads. All of the beads are stained with a colourless finish, and the string holding the bracelet together is a dark indigo colour.

&quot;Is that the hidden immunity idol?&quot; Denine asks, knowing the answer all too well.

&quot;They have a great reason to split the vote,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;But I have a bit of a long shot plan to get us both into the next round. I assume you&#39;re in, because the alternative doesn&#39;t look all that great for you.&quot;

&quot;Kidnap Louie so we have more leverage?&quot; Denine asks.

&quot;Let them kidnap someone,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;If we kidnap Louie next round, then worst case scenario there&#39;d be four of them and only three of us still.&quot;

&quot;Even if they vote out one of their own, they&#39;d still have the numbers next round,&quot; says Denine. &quot;So really we&#39;re just delaying the inevitable.&quot;

&quot;Too bad you&#39;re going to do it.&quot; Rocky grins. &quot;I&#39;m not the one in danger here.&quot;

//&quot;So Rocky completely ruins everything for everyone, then tries throwing me under the bus, THEN wants me to forgive him!?&quot; Denine folds her arms. &quot;He&#39;s a bona fide dumbass. I don&#39;t want to deal with the other people here, though. I&#39;m doing nothing but sitting here getting rained on, and I just want to go and break something.&quot;//

Town Square**]

&quot;One vote. You couldn&#39;t even hold it together for ONE VOTE.&quot;

As the six remaining members of Quibas arrive at the Town Square with Rhett, Jennifer is busy giving Jackie a hard time.

&quot;I thought we were going to work together,&quot; says Jennifer, &quot;but what do you go and do? You stab me in the back and work for you know who!&quot;

&quot;I said I wanted to work with you,&quot; says Jackie, &quot;but I also said that Monty was weak, he sucks, and he had to go.&quot;

&quot;You never said that! What the hell are you on?&quot; Jennifer protests.

//&quot;I&#39;m really disappointed in Jackie and Khall right now,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;We had the numbers, and they just flip on us because they can&#39;t let the past go. I&#39;m pissed, because who knows if we&#39;re going to get a chance like that again?&quot;//

&quot;You&#39;re making up a justification on the fly,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;You&#39;re hiding something!&quot;

&quot;Stand down, guys,&quot; says Paula. &quot;She never liked Monty, even from the start. It made sense to her, it was just horrible timing on her part.&quot;

&quot;Horrible timing? Oh come on, he wasn&#39;t your dad or anything,&quot; Jackie replies. &quot;Let it go, it&#39;s a game.&quot;

&quot;Stuff it, Jackie,&quot; Jennifer snaps. &quot;&#39;It&#39;s a game&#39; but it&#39;s a million-dollar game. Of course we&#39;re going to take it seriously.&quot;

&quot;Monty didn&#39;t,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;He was just here to &#39;have a good time and make friends&#39;. Like, who does that?&quot;

&quot;I do,&quot; says Khall.

&quot;That&#39;s, uh, great.&quot; Jackie turns to Khall. &quot;You can go and build a sandcastle, or stand on a cactus, or something now.&quot;

Khall shrugs. &quot;I guess it is my defining character trait.&quot; He walks off.

//&quot;Monty&#39;s gone, which is great for personal AND strategic reasons,&quot; says Denine. &quot;But what I didn&#39;t expect is for Jennifer to flip her lid, not on me or Rocky, but on Jackie. Please, burn some more bridges, I beg of you.&quot;//

&quot;I&#39;m going to go and try to recuperate,&quot; says Paula. She turns around and walks back to camp, hands in her pockets.

&quot;Awesome job,&quot; says Jennifer, &quot;you broke Paula.&quot;

&quot;Serves her right for voting out Tara,&quot; Jackie replies.

&quot;The first boot girl? You&#39;re still bitter about that?&quot; Rocky chuckles. &quot;I don&#39;t even remember the name of the first person I voted out.&quot;

&quot;Min-Ji,&quot; Denine, Jackie, Jennifer, and Rhett say all at once.

&quot;Oh yeah.&quot;

&quot;Was that so hard?&quot; Denine asks sarcastically.

//&quot;So Paula and Jennifer are upset about Monty leaving. So what? Now they know how it feels,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;You get rid of my friend, I get rid of yours. If anything you should be glad that it took as long as it did. And to be honest, I&#39;d like to see Paula follow him right out, considering how close they were.&quot;//

$q[**Quibas**]

Paula arrives back at camp, walks right past Khall (who is doing a handstand on a small cactus), and sits in the shelter. She buries her face in her knees, trying to keep herself from sobbing.

Khall notices Paula&#39;s distress, drops off the cactus, and walks over to Paula, giving her a big hug.

Paula can&#39;t hold it together any longer. She begins to cry into Khall&#39;s cloak.

&quot;I&#39;m really sorry,&quot; says Khall.

Paula says nothing, but returns the embrace.

&quot;It&#39;s alright, Paula, it&#39;s okay to be sad over losing a friend,&quot; he continues.

&quot;It&#39;s not even that,&quot; says Paula. &quot;I knew at some point Monty was going to get voted out. I just... didn&#39;t think it would be so sudden.&quot;

&quot;And the way the other side seemed so mean-spirited about it,&quot; Khall adds.

&quot;Exactly! See, you get it!&quot;

//&quot;There are more feelings to Survivor than pride over getting a vote right, and anger over getting blindsided. I think some people don&#39;t realize that,&quot; Khall explains. &quot;This tribe doesn&#39;t have that human aspect right now.&quot;//

&quot;I have to ask, how do you manage to put up with that?&quot; Paula asks.

&quot;Put up with what?&quot; Khall asks in return.

&quot;Jackie&#39;s attitude, she&#39;s so dismissive of you,&quot; says Paula. &quot;She&#39;s been using you for a vote. I don&#39;t see what you have in common.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s easy,&quot; says Khall. &quot;We make an entertaining duo because we&#39;re opposites. Our dynamic alternates based on whether the scene wants me to call out Jackie&#39;s recklessness and lack of foresight, or if it wants her to call out my flightiness and lack of common sense.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t get it.&quot; Paula wipes her eyes. &quot;Jackie isn&#39;t the only person in the game, is she?&quot;

Khall shakes his head.

&quot;Then why do you act like she is? Do you really want to just be her follower?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not that I want to,&quot; says Khall. &quot;It&#39;s just the way things work out, I guess.&quot;

//&quot;I came back absolutely defeated,&quot; Paula explains, red in the face from crying, &quot;and it just all came out. I&#39;m glad I had Khall here to make me feel better. I just also have to break up his alliance before it even forms, so that&#39;s what I tried to do.&quot;//

&quot;You think in terms of story lines, right?&quot; Paula asks.

&quot;It&#39;s what I&#39;m used to,&quot; Khall replies.

&quot;I think I have an idea,&quot; says Paula. &quot;What story line do you think is happening right now with you and Jackie?&quot;

&quot;You know, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve considered that,&quot; says Khall. &quot;What story line //is// happening?&quot;

&quot;Well, Jackie criticized Monty for having an attitude similar to yours,&quot; says Paula. &quot;When you spoke up, she dismissed you. You lean on her for strategic advice, even when you know she&#39;s making a mistake.&quot;

&quot;I got it!&quot; Khall snaps his fingers. &quot;This is still kind of the build-up, when a villainous character takes another character they think is slower, and tries to use them as a second vote, maybe even as a goat.&quot;

Paula&#39;s eyes widen. &quot;And you don&#39;t see the problem here?&quot;

&quot;Not really,&quot; Khall replies. &quot;The slower character, if they aren&#39;t a first boot, tend to make it deep into the swap before they&#39;re cut.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re in the seventh round,&quot; says Paula.

&quot;Oooh, that&#39;s a problem,&quot; Khall replies. &quot;Eliminating me here would need some really contrived events to go down in the next few days..&quot;

&quot;It took a lot of contrived events for Monty to suddenly be voted out,&quot; Paula counters.

Khall blinks. &quot;You&#39;re right...&quot;

&quot;My point is,&quot; Paula continues, &quot;it doesn&#39;t have to end that way.&quot;

//&quot;I was wondering why I was getting so much visibility with Paula if we weren&#39;t connected by an alliance,&quot; says Khall. &quot;But this makes perfect sense. Maybe I&#39;m not meant to take the fall for Jackie. It&#39;s just a question of when that will come into play.&quot;//

$c[**Chalpe**]

Ashleia and Rhett are watching Buddy attempt to start a fire for the tribe.

&quot;This shouldn&#39;t take too long, I hope,&quot; says Buddy.

&quot;I seem to remember a fairly large argument happen the last time you said that,&quot; Rhett replies.

Buddy stops, gives Rhett a dirty look, and gets back to work.

&quot;We can&#39;t take any more time getting this started,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;We are all soaked. We need the fire to help us dry off, right?&quot;

&quot;You know, you don&#39;t have to question yourself all the time,&quot; Buddy replies.

&quot;I&#39;m not. I&#39;m just, like, saying.&quot;

//&quot;I can come up with ideas of my own,&quot; says Ashleia, bringing a hand to her chest. &quot;I&#39;m not stupid, I&#39;m a grown woman who can handle herself. I need to prove myself, and I won&#39;t do that by laying low.&quot;//

&quot;I think I got something,&quot; Buddy says quietly.

Rhett and Ashleia nod in approval, then turn to each other.

&quot;So how do you feel about this group right here?&quot; Ashleia asks. &quot;Like, I was hoping we could come together last time but that didn&#39;t work.&quot;

&quot;Every vote is different,&quot; Rhett explains. &quot;We needed to get rid of Jarrett last time. I don&#39;t think we need to get rid of anyone this time.&quot;

&quot;You aren&#39;t, like, going to turn on me and Buddy?&quot; Ashleia asks.

Rhett shakes his head. &quot;Unless you have any idols I should be worried about.&quot;

Ashleia looks a little surprised. &quot;I don&#39;t have any idols.&quot;

&quot;It would camouflage perfectly with your jewellery,&quot; says Rhett.

//&quot;After the complete and utter humiliation I went through yesterday, I&#39;ve realized that nobody here can be trusted,&quot; Rhett explains. &quot;Ashleia was on Rocky&#39;s tribe, and they failed to vote him out. How can I be sure that she&#39;s not working with him... or worse, working **for** him?//

&quot;I&#39;ve got something,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;Ash, come here, help me get it going.&quot;

Ashleia nods, and kneels next to Buddy. The two attempt to feed the small flame with dry leaves, and gently blowing so it will catch.

&quot;The hell is up with Rhett?&quot; Buddy asks.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Ashleia replies. &quot;Like, I don&#39;t get why he&#39;s so suspicious of everyone all of a sudden.&quot;

&quot;Maybe he&#39;s just shaken up over the vote,&quot; Buddy replies. &quot;We were all talking about how we hope they finally get rid of Rocky, and lo and behold he&#39;s still over there.&quot;

Ashleia looks over at Buddy in shock. &quot;Are you serious? They didn&#39;t vote him out?&quot;

&quot;There was a split vote plan, and it went haywire, apparently,&quot; says Buddy.

//&quot;So like, three different times people have been going after Rocky,&quot; says Ashleia, &quot;and then it changes at the last second and he&#39;s still here. I have a feeling that, like, this time it&#39;s not because someone didn&#39;t trust Monty. This is the game getting serious.&quot;//

&quot;We can&#39;t take him for granted anymore,&quot; says Ashleia.

&quot;Right. And if he finally does go, there are going to be people without any game plan because getting Rocky out is all they&#39;re talking about,&quot; Buddy adds.

&quot;We should have the same game plan,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;You&#39;re honest, and I need someone who&#39;s honest on my side.&quot;

&quot;Deal,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;Let&#39;s keep an ear out, after almost a week something has got to give.&quot;

//&quot;The whole tribe has been kind of disoriented since Jarrett left,&quot; Buddy explains. &quot;We have side deals here and there, but nothing is really coming together. Which is great for me and Ashleia, because we were on the wrong side last time. Jarrett was the A-type personality, and without him the others are just lost.&quot;//

$q[**Quibas**]

Denine is leaning against a tree with her right arm propped up above her head, when Rocky walks up to her.

&quot;Hey, bestie,&quot; says Rocky with a fake enthusiasm.

Denine rolls her eyes and looks away.

&quot;Clearly you aren&#39;t doing anything important,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;What are you thinking about?&quot;

&quot;How much everyone here sucks,&quot; says Denine, &quot;including you.&quot;

&quot;But who sucks enough to be voted out?&quot;

//&quot;We pulled off a great blindside last night,&quot; Rocky gloats. &quot;They were furious! We have the upper hand now, so we gotta keep that momentum and not let this opportunity go to waste.&quot;//

&quot;Really, anyone,&quot; says Denine. &quot;I&#39;m just waiting to get to the merge to hook back up with Louie.&quot;

&quot;Speaking of obvious duos,&quot; Rocky continues, &quot;you think we should stick with Jackie and Khall?&quot;

Denine nods. &quot;Jackie wants Paula out, she&#39;ll get heat for that again, not us. And Jennifer wants nothing to do with any of us.&quot;

&quot;Should we split the vote between Paula and Jen?&quot; Rocky asks. He and Denine look each other in the eyes for a second before bursting into laughter.

//&quot;The rest of the tribe was expecting to have everyone around them fall in line,&quot; says Denine. &quot;The problem with that strategy is that it&#39;s stupid. You don&#39;t cast votes to send a message, you cast a vote to send a bitch packing, and that&#39;s the end of that. So that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to do with my vote.&quot;//

Meanwhile, Jackie and Khall are sitting together by the fire.

&quot;I kind of feel bad for voting Monty out,&quot; says Khall. &quot;He was a nice guy.&quot;

&quot;Then we did not know the same guy named Monty,&quot; Jackie replies. &quot;He was obnoxious, he was ignorant, he was uncultured, and he was holding us back. Just watch, without him we&#39;re going to go back to winning.&quot;

&quot;Is winning all that matters to you?&quot; Khall asks.

&quot;No, of course not,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;It also matters that I do better than my sister.&quot;

//&quot;Despite being totally witless, somehow my twin sister Emily managed to get 11th place when she played. And she wouldn&#39;t have gotten that far if it wasn&#39;t for Rex, so if I can do better than her with an ally dumber than Rex, that&#39;s its own kind of victory.&quot;//

Denine then approaches the pair and sits down between them. &quot;Listen, we need to talk about our next steps,&quot; she says. &quot;So Jennifer hates us, and Paula&#39;s with her. We&#39;re going to have to stick together now.&quot;

&quot;Then we&#39;re voting out Paula,&quot; says Jackie without missing a beat.

&quot;Done. Do we need to kidnap anyone to make that happen?&quot; Denine asks.

&quot;You, me, Rocky, and Khall. That&#39;s four. We don&#39;t need any more,&quot; says Jackie, &quot;let&#39;s not make a mistake and split it.&quot;

&quot;Jennifer&#39;s stronger than Paula,&quot; says Denine, &quot;that&#39;s my only reservation. We can&#39;t keep Rocky around to stop her from winning immunities, because at some point he needs to go as well.&quot;

&quot;We just need to wait for a trivia immunity challenge then,&quot; says Jackie.

Denine smirks. &quot;Yeah, I could take her down in that.&quot;

&quot;I was talking about myself beating her, but go off,&quot; says Jackie.

&quot;I could probably beat her in a trivia challenge too,&quot; says Khall.

&quot;If Khall can beat her, she&#39;s nothing to worry about.&quot; Jackie flips her hair. &quot;So there&#39;s no reason to keep Paula.&quot;

//&quot;Paula tried to shade me for a poor social game, but who&#39;s the one with the majority alliance now?&quot; Denine shrugs, and smiles. &quot;I&#39;m not afraid of her or whatever plans she has, because I intend to keep the numbers and use them correctly.&quot;//

$c[**Chalpe**]

&quot;I feel nauseous...&quot;

Candace is sitting down, back propped against a tree. Vaclav is sitting near her, sometimes looking at her, sometimes staring into the sky.

&quot;Do you need something to eat?&quot; Vaclav asks. &quot;You can have half of my rice if it would help you feel better.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know, it might just come back up.&quot; Candace holds her head. &quot;This sucks.&quot;

&quot;We don&#39;t have a challenge today, so try and take it easy,&quot; says Vaclav.

//&quot;I have this queasy feeling in my gut that I can&#39;t shake,&quot; says Candace. &quot;It makes me feel like crap, and it&#39;s like everything around me is... five times worse. The sun&#39;s too bright but the shade is too cold, nature is too noisy, my clothes are itchy, and I just don&#39;t want to talk to anyone.&quot;//

&quot;I&#39;m such an idiot. Why did I think I would be able to just kick the habit in a time like this?&quot; Candace groans.

&quot;Kick the habit?&quot; Vaclav&#39;s eyes open wide. &quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell us this earlier? I&#39;m not going to judge you for it.&quot;

&quot;Because really it&#39;s not your business,&quot; Candace replies coldly.

&quot;When you&#39;re feeling weak and sad,&quot; says Vaclav, &quot;it&#39;s the tribe&#39;s business.&quot;

&quot;...fine.&quot; Candace takes a deep breath. &quot;I used to vape. It was just harmless stuff, right? Blowing cloud rings, doing tricks, looking cool. I knew better than to do drugs, I barely even touched weed. But it was just a little liquid. I even stayed away from the gunk that probably had nicotine in it!&quot;

&quot;Was it a hobby?&quot;

&quot;Pretty much.&quot; Candace gently bites her lower lip for a second before continuing. &quot;My friends all did it. I thought I could be smart about vaping while doing it. I guess I was wrong.&quot;

//&quot;When Candace told me her story about vaping, I was a little confused,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;How can you be addicted... if there is no drug? I feel bad for her, but I don&#39;t know what is really wrong.&quot;//

Louie arrives a little later, and he pulls Vaclav aside to talk.

&quot;She&#39;s not feeling so hot,&quot; Vaclav explained. &quot;I don&#39;t know if she&#39;s sick or not.&quot;

&quot;We might need to vote her out if she is,&quot; says Louie, &quot;for her own sake.&quot;

&quot;What? But she sided with us,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;Do you really want to stab her in the back? She would not be very happy.&quot;

&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter to me,&quot; Louie replies. &quot;Her health comes first, and if that&#39;s what we use to vote her out, then that&#39;s what it has to be.&quot;

&quot;I would not be very happy if someone did that to me and I was not sick,&quot; says Vaclav.

&quot;Well, if she&#39;s not sick, we vote someone else,&quot; says Louie. &quot;The others have their reasons too. Listen, Vaclav, if you have a chance to eliminate someone without them even realizing they&#39;re in danger, you take it.&quot;

//&quot;We have six people left on each tribe, and that doesn&#39;t leave much room for error,&quot; says Louie. &quot;We&#39;re past the point where votes were based on common sense consensus. I&#39;m not looking for the one that brings the team down, I&#39;m looking for who makes a good target.&quot;//

Reward Challenge**

Everyone is competing in the beloved Pesky Palate challenge. Two players from opposing tribes will go head to head and see who can eat a native dish that might not sit well with them. First tribe to reach four points wins a trip to a Survivor Burger Bar with beer and cocktails to get the taste out of their mouth.

&#39;&#39;Round One:&#39;&#39; $c[Vaclav] vs $q[Rocky]

Rocky tells his tribe he&#39;s going to show them how it&#39;s done, only to have quite a bit of difficulty. Regardless, he finishes before Vaclav can, scoring the first point for $q[Quibas].

&#39;&#39;Round Two:&#39;&#39; $c[Buddy] vs $q[Jackie]

Jackie is incredibly hesitant, and Buddy takes advantage of her squeamishness to tie it up for $c[Chalpe].

&#39;&#39;Round Three:&#39;&#39; $c[Louie] vs $q[Khall]

Louie devours his dish before Khall can even react, putting $c[Chalpe] in the lead.

&#39;&#39;Round Four:&#39;&#39; $c[Rhett] vs $q[Paula]

In the closest match-up of the day, Rhett and Paula both manage to choke down the majority of their dishes. The first one to swallow their last bite is Paula, giving $q[Quibas] another point.

&#39;&#39;Round Five:&#39;&#39; $c[Ashleia] vs $q[Jennifer]


Both girls are squeamish, but neither backs down from the challenge. Ashleia struggles to recover after a too-large bite, however, and Jennifer comes back from behind to score the third point for $q[Quibas].

&#39;&#39;Round Six:&#39;&#39; $c[Candace] vs $q[Denine]

Candace takes one look at her dish, nearly vomits, and then passes out. Denine takes her time to finish her dish, not even looking at Candace.

$q[Quibas wins reward!]
$c[Chalpe loses, and returns to camp with nothing.]

**Reward - $q[Quibas]**

The winning tribe arrives at the burger bar, all of them ecstatic to get their hands on a good, filling meal.

&quot;Make sure to savour it,&quot; says Denine as she assembles a burger, &quot;you gotta have it sink in more than the garbage we ate to win this.&quot;

//&quot;I was wondering if we would get around to doing the Survivor buffet challenge,&quot; says Denine. &quot;And now that we actually did, I feel so amazing that I not only won my round but clinched the reward for my team! I totally could have done it even if my opponent didn&#39;t completely fall apart, too.&quot;//

After having a few bites, some of the women excuse themselves, leaving Jennifer sitting with Khall and Rocky at the bar.

&quot;Jennifer,&quot; says Rocky after taking a bite of his second burger, &quot;I think we got off on the wrong foot.&quot;

Jennifer raises her eyebrows and drops her jaw. She says nothing, but the intensity of her sarcastic expression says enough.

&quot;We&#39;ve both made mistakes, and I don&#39;t want to just be everyone&#39;s enemy all game,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;Care to forget the past and start fresh?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s going to take a lot more than that,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;I&#39;m not going to be quick to forgive someone who needlessly harassed my tribe when we lost one time. You never have a good word to say about anyone. I don&#39;t like you as a person, and I don&#39;t want anything to do with you. Unless you say something that keeps both me and Paula safe if we lose, don&#39;t talk to me.&quot;

&quot;Jennifer, I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t vote with you,&quot; says Khall, &quot;but you don&#39;t have to box all of us out.&quot;

&quot;I would understand if it was a normal blindside,&quot; Jennifer replies, &quot;but Monty didn&#39;t do anything wrong. He was the one who said we should give Rocky a chance. We did, and then he blew it.&quot;

&quot;Are you actually mourning him?&quot; Rocky asks in disbelief. &quot;If he was as good as you say he was, he would have been a jury threat anyways. Think about it: &#39;Ah&#39;m here because Ah want a better life for mah young&#39;uns.&#39; Everyone would eat that up and you know it. That&#39;s why I wanted to toss him like a moldy banana.&quot;

&quot;First, bananas don&#39;t usually get moldy,&quot; says Jennifer, &quot;so you&#39;re an idiot. Second, isn&#39;t it just so convenient that you eliminated the guy that everyone liked except for Denine and Jackie? Hmm, what do those two have in common?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t imply they&#39;re using me,&quot; Rocky snaps. &quot;It&#39;s the other way around. We both know that the two of us are the only ones actually using our brains here.&quot;

&quot;Hey, don&#39;t say that in front of Khall,&quot; says Jennifer.

&quot;He doesn&#39;t mind,&quot; Rocky replies.

&quot;I do mind, actually,&quot; says Khall. &quot;I just didn&#39;t want to get involved.&quot;

//&quot;Jennifer is my biggest rival right now,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;She&#39;s the only one who can really stand up to me, and that&#39;s kind of a problem. I don&#39;t want her out yet, if anything I think we can work together.&quot;//

&quot;Here&#39;s the thing,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;We&#39;re going to win tomorrow. If we somehow don&#39;t, Paula&#39;s going home. We&#39;re going to need to stick together to survive at the merge.&quot;

&quot;If you think I&#39;m going to agree to that, you&#39;re crazy,&quot; says Jennifer.

&quot;Which part?&quot; Rocky asks.

&quot;All of it, but especially the part about voting Paula. Over my dead body.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s her or you,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;And considering my friends want to vote Paula out, you should consider yourself lucky. And if you don&#39;t want to play along, that&#39;s fine. You can follow her right out the door.&quot;

Jennifer shakes her head. &quot;If all you have are empty threats, then this circles back to the whole &#39;shut up, Rocky&#39; thing I was talking about. Bartender, can I get a Long Island iced tea?&quot;

//&quot;This tribe is swelling with egos,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;Rocky has one, Denine has one, Jackie has one. No way should those three all be able to keep it together. I&#39;m going to do everything I can to keep the only trustworthy person I have left from getting voted out.&quot;//

Denine, Jackie, and Paula had excused themselves to have a conversation away from the burger bar.

&quot;So, what did you call us over here for?&quot; Denine asks. &quot;You&#39;re holding me back from the alcohol, and mama&#39;s got needs.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m looking to shake things up,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;Paula, Denine, I trust you guys more than those three over there to not be dumb, so I&#39;m telling you only. I think Rocky&#39;s a threat, and we need to get him out.&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot; Denine looks at Jackie in shock.

Paula narrows her eyes. &quot;Well, Jackie, we were going to do that, and you decided to be selfish and made me lose my good friend. So why should I believe you this time?&quot;

&quot;He knew he was on the outs last time,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;He saw it coming, so I had to vote Monty to make him //think// that I flipped.&quot;

&quot;If you weren&#39;t flipping then why did you do it?&quot; Denine asks.

&quot;We could afford to lose him,&quot; says Jackie.

//&quot;I want to keep my options open,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;Rocky is going for Paula, Paula is going for Rocky, Jennifer and Denine I don&#39;t care, they&#39;ll stick with their allies. I&#39;m going to make sure I can kidnap the right person, so with Khall I&#39;ll have the majority and take out anyone.&quot;//

&quot;So you want me to vote Rocky, even though people have tried and failed to do so three times already?&quot; Paula asks. &quot;He&#39;s still here, and I&#39;m starting to grow tired of the same old plan failing over and over.&quot;

&quot;Your other option is to vote out Jennifer,&quot; says Denine. &quot;That&#39;s the option I suggest you go with, anyways.&quot;

&quot;If it&#39;s the only thing I can do, then I might have to,&quot; Paula replies. &quot;You know I don&#39;t really want to, though.&quot;

&quot;The ball&#39;s in your court,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;Just be sure to tell us, Jennifer or Rocky. One of them has to go.&quot; She walks off, giving a sly wink to Denine on the way back to the bar.

Denine looks back at Paula. &quot;I&#39;m not going to lie, blindsiding Rocky when he thinks he&#39;s finally safe is tempting.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t believe a single word that comes out of Jackie&#39;s mouth anymore,&quot; Paula replies, crossing her arms. &quot;She&#39;s not really planning to do that. Besides, she&#39;s dead to me.&quot; She blinks. &quot;Just don&#39;t tell her I said that.&quot;

//&quot;If Jackie really did want to make amends, I don&#39;t see why she would wait so long to ask me,&quot; says Paula. &quot;I have a feeling that she wants either me or Jennifer out. I really need us to win tomorrow.&quot;//

$c[**Chalpe**]

Candace is lying down in the shelter, with a jacket draped over her. It is difficult to tell whether she is asleep, or merely trying to be.

Vaclav looks at her, then looks back at Rhett. &quot;I think we should leave her be. It&#39;s best for her.&quot;

//&quot;I think the reward would have been nice,&quot; says Candace. Her face is unusually pale. &quot;But when they needed my point to stay in, Quibas was already ahead. The reward wasn&#39;t worth it, in my opinion. I&#39;m more embarrassed that I fainted than I am upset.&quot;//

&quot;This is the worst I&#39;ve seen her,&quot; says Rhett.

Vaclav nods. &quot;I&#39;m worried. If she doesn&#39;t get better, we might have to vote her out so she gets better. That&#39;s a safe vote... a bit too safe. I can&#39;t be sure someone will use Candace being sick to split the vote.&quot;

&quot;There aren&#39;t many people callous and cruel enough to keep someone who&#39;s clearly suffering in a state like this,&quot; says Rhett.

&quot;If you&#39;re never callous and cruel, you can never win this game,&quot; Vaclav replies. &quot;There are no good guys, only temporary friends.&quot;

//&quot;Vaclav is a very dangerous person,&quot; says Rhett. He folds his arms. &quot;He refuses to engage in good faith dialogues, and no bond is sacred to him. People like him, who are completely self-serving, are the most easily corrupted by those with money and power.&quot; Rhett lowers his voice to a somewhat loud whisper. &quot;I have a sinking feeling that Vaclav would plunge a knife in your back if the despotic Vincent Boucher or his producer henchmen demanded it.&quot;//

Louie approaches his tribemates, and discretely taps Vaclav on the arm with one finger. &quot;I want to try something,&quot; he whispers.

Vaclav makes a slight shrug gesture.

&quot;She&#39;s not really looking much better, is she?&quot; Louie asks.

&quot;She hasn&#39;t talked to us since after the challenge,&quot; Rhett replies.

&quot;Mind if I take a look at her?&quot; Louie nudges Vaclav.

&quot;Go ahead.&quot;

Louie walks over to Candace, kneels close to her, and pretends to take her vitals.

&quot;Nothing personal,&quot; he whispers to Candace, before getting up again.

//&quot;I nearly went home last time we voted,&quot; says Louie. &quot;Normally I would be sweating bullets, but Vaclav is fine with me and everyone else is kind of an idiot.&quot; He smirks and leans forward over his pudgy legs. &quot;I don&#39;t see my name coming up tomorrow, and if it does, it won&#39;t mean anything.&quot;//

&quot;Yeah, it looks really bad,&quot; says Louie. &quot;It&#39;s probably contagious. I suggest you try to avoid any physical contact with her, and try not to touch the same things she touches. Otherwise, you might get sick too.&quot;

Vaclav and Rhett both look at the shelter and notice that Candace is sleeping under Rhett&#39;s purple and blue plaid jacket.

&quot;We can carry one sick person, but not two,&quot; Louie continues.

&quot;She&#39;s... using my jacket...&quot; Rhett stammers.

&quot;Why isn&#39;t she using her own?&quot; Vaclav asks.

&quot;Couldn&#39;t find it, I guess,&quot; Louie replies. &quot;And I couldn&#39;t give mine up. I don&#39;t want jaguar flu.&quot;

&quot;She has jaguar flu!? Why aren&#39;t the medics doing anything?&quot; Rhett&#39;s eyes go wide. &quot;This is insane! Someone, anyone, help!&quot; He runs off, looking for someone to help.

Vaclav stares wide-eyed at Louie. &quot;Does she really have jaguar flu?&quot; he asks.

&quot;There&#39;s no such thing as jaguar flu,&quot; says Louie. &quot;For someone who says he&#39;s an intellectual activist, he&#39;s not that bright.&quot;

//&quot;I do not know why Rhett is so quick to trust some people but not others,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;He thinks Vincent, who is always nice and friendly, is out to get him. But for the people he lives with, who really could be plotting against him right in front of his face, he is gullible! I just do not understand.&quot;//

$t[**Town Square**]

Jackie, Ashleia, and Buddy all arrive at the town square at the same time from their respective tribes.

&quot;It&#39;s good to see you&#39;re still alive,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;How was reward?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t eat a lot,&quot; Jackie replies. &quot;I was busy thinking for most of the time.&quot;

&quot;Do you think the tribes will come together soon?&quot; Ashleia asks.

Jackie nods. &quot;And I&#39;m glad that I ran into you guys, because I&#39;m definitely better off with you guys come merge than with my current tribe.&quot;

&quot;We, like, already have the numbers,&quot; says Ashleia.

&quot;You trust those people not to flip? We need backup,&quot; Buddy tells her.

&quot;You&#39;re right, sorry.&quot; Ashleia&#39;s eyebrows lower, her expression losing its joy.

//&quot;Buddy seems to have something against the others, no matter where he is,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;I don&#39;t take it personally, I&#39;ve been around even more disrespectful men. He isn&#39;t smug about it like they are, and that&#39;s what, like, gets me so confused.&quot;//

&quot;Who do you actually want out, that&#39;s what we need to know,&quot; says Buddy.

&quot;Paula,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;Monty&#39;s gone, so now her time is up, too.&quot;

Buddy&#39;s expression turns to confusion. &quot;Your... wasn&#39;t Paula your ally? You were on the same tribe together.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, we were,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;But you were on the same tribe as Denine, and she says you two hate each other.&quot;

&quot;Denine&#39;s a psychotic bitch who doesn&#39;t know when to stop,&quot; Buddy replies. &quot;What did //Paula// do to you? She&#39;s... she seems nice enough.&quot;

&quot;She just doesn&#39;t listen to me,&quot; Jackie replies. &quot;And I can&#39;t communicate with someone who doesn&#39;t communicate back. You don&#39;t want to put your trust into someone like Paula who&#39;s difficult, manipulative, and-&quot;

&quot;Alright, we&#39;re done talking,&quot; says Buddy.

&quot;Excuse me?&quot; Jackie snaps.

&quot;Did you not hear me?&quot; Buddy replies. &quot;Bye, Jackie!&quot;

//&quot;I feel like I have to stand up for Paula sometimes,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;Not because she can&#39;t do it herself, but she just doesn&#39;t want to. She&#39;ll try to get around an obstacle before confronting it. The Paula that I know is nothing like what Jackie is saying about her, so I know that Jackie is a bad liar and a bad ally.&quot;//

&quot;Um, Buddy, I think you&#39;re being a bit too, like, harsh,&quot; says Ashleia.

&quot;And honestly how dare you,&quot; says Jackie.

&quot;Jackie, who else would you vote out with our tribe?&quot; Ashleia asks.

&quot;Like, I think Rocky and Jennifer,&quot; Jackie replies.

&quot;We can&#39;t trust her to vote out Rocky,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;And hell no about Jennifer.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know if we can, like, actually vote Rocky out either so we&#39;re not going to try for right now,&quot; says Ashleia.

&quot;Well,&quot; Jackie puts her hands on her hips and blows a raspberry. &quot;He&#39;s my other target, so if you loooove Paula and Jennifer so much, you should vote him out anyways.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re a waste of space,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;Bye bye. Get out.&quot;

//&quot;I am speechless,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;I thought I could get Ashleia or Buddy to make sure Paula went home, but they&#39;re just so stubborn. Well, they&#39;ll have something coming when we merge. It might not be right away, but I will make sure they have zero chance of winning.&quot;//

Immunity Challenge**

This challenge has two parts. In the first part, five contestants on each tribe have to alternate between jumping over and crawling under a set of eight horizontal beams. They must then lift one person up to a high platform, where they will cut a rope that releases a ladder for the other four to climb. All five of the contestants will then climb down a mesh ramp that returns them to ground level, where they face an oversized, sixteen-piece number puzzle. The sixth player has to direct the rest of their tribe to finish the puzzle. First tribe to complete the puzzle wins immunity.

Both tribes quickly agree on an order. The physical component will be done by everyone except for $c[Ashleia] and $q[Jackie], who will direct the puzzle component.

Out of the gate, Chalpe is slowed down by Louie, who struggles to pull himself over the beams due to his weight.

Khall attempts to jump off one beam into a somersault underneath the next, but instead face-plants on the second beam. Despite Paula&#39;s concerns, he gets up and shakes the injury off as if nothing happened.

Quibas arrives at the platform slightly before Chalpe, and they choose to lift Paula up to the platform. By the time they hoist her up, Louie has finally caught up with the rest of Chalpe.

Paula picks up the machete, gets a feel for it, then steadily gets to work on cutting the rope.

Chalpe chooses to lift Buddy up to their platform. Buddy takes his machete and forcefully swipes at the rope. The two best friends focus on the challenge, neither taking more than a glance at the other.

Buddy finishes first, and when the ladder is released Candace races up first. Vaclav and Rhett stay behind to try and help Louie up the ladder before them. Candace stops and sits down when she reaches the top to catch her breath and wait for Louie.

While Louie is climbing the ladder, Paula cuts her rope and the Quibas ladder comes down.

Chalpe gets everyone up their ladder, they all run down the mesh ramp, and Ashleia immediately starts giving out instructions.

Quibas takes slightly longer to get everyone up, and they all run down the mesh ramp together. Jackie starts rushing out commands to everyone in an attempt to take the lead back.

Both tribes make a mistake or two, but it does not take too long for one tribe to find a rhythm. They take about five minutes to push all of the oversized number blocks into the right positions.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$c[Chalpe gets the right answer first, and they win immunity!]
$q[Quibas loses, and will be headed to tribal council to vote off one of their own.]

Vincent tells Quibas to kidnap someone besides Rhett from the Chalpe tribe. The majority votes to kidnap Vaclav.

$c[**Chalpe**]

After a satisfying victory, the Chalpe tribe is beginning to settle down for the night. Ashleia and Candace take a walk down a main path from camp, leaving the male tribemates to their own devices.

&quot;I think I&#39;m getting better,&quot; says Candace to Ashleia. &quot;I was able to push through today. I didn&#39;t want to hold us back from immunity.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Ashleia replies. &quot;I know it must have been hard for you. If I was feeling as sick as you were yesterday, I wouldn&#39;t be able to function.&quot;

Candace nods. &quot;I knew it was do or die.&quot;

//&quot;I couldn&#39;t tell you how much of that was in my head versus actually coming down with something,&quot; Candace explains. &quot;I hit a boiling point. Day in and day out, I have to deal with toxic energy from almost everyone around me, and you can&#39;t just take that on the chin.&quot;//

&quot;I would have tried to find a way to save you,&quot; says Ashleia.

&quot;I appreciate it, Ash, I really do,&quot; Candace replies. &quot;But some of our teammates are out for blood. If they kidnapped the wrong person they would have tried to pull a power move. When someone has an idol, you can&#39;t predict how it&#39;s going to be played.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I wasn&#39;t even thinking about that,&quot; says Ashleia.

&quot;It&#39;s late enough in the game to be worrying about that,&quot; says Candace.

//&quot;I wasn&#39;t, like, thinking about an idol for one reason,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;If someone has it, they need to be sure it&#39;s worth not having it later. Nobody is going to take a sick person out premerge with an idol. They would be looking at people who scare them or hate them, and I haven&#39;t been scaring or hating anyone.&quot;//

&quot;I think I&#39;ll get better if the fighting stops,&quot; says Candace.

The girls arrive back at camp, and see Buddy and Louie standing next to the chicken cage.

&quot;We might as well, to celebrate our win and all,&quot; says Buddy.

&quot;We only have one chicken left, and it hasn&#39;t even been a week,&quot; Louie replies. &quot;We can still get some eggs out of her.&quot;

&quot;Oh boy, one or two eggs divided between six people,&quot; says Buddy, rolling his eyes. &quot;And that will make all the difference.&quot;

&quot;As opposed to one chicken today and no eggs ever again?&quot; Louie asks.

&quot;If we merge next round, we would have to share that chicken,&quot; says Buddy, &quot;and it would be dumb of us to do that. This is **our** advantage that we won, we might as well enjoy it ourselves?&quot;

&quot;And if we don&#39;t merge, then you look like an idiot.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m clearly not the only one willing to take that risk.&quot;

Ashleia looks over at Candace, who is pinching the bridge of her nose. Suddenly, Candace nearly throws down her arm, and shouts at Buddy and Louie. &quot;Who gave you the chicken rights!?&quot;

&quot;Chicken rights?&quot; Louie asks, confused.

&quot;Rhett&#39;s the one who knows about chickens, why are you having a bitchfest about something you know nothing about?&quot; Candace yells. &quot;Have you even been feeding them since we got it? Because if not, we&#39;re going to have some weak ass chicken meat on our hands!&quot;

&quot;Candace,&quot; Ashleia calls out, &quot;you just told me that this was the whole issue!&quot;

&quot;This in particular,&quot; Candace replies, &quot;this **nonstop** battle of the egos, is **everyone&#39;s problem!**&quot;

Ashleia sighs.

//&quot;I&#39;m only hoping that the other tribe is as much of a total mess as ours,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;We&#39;re going to need all the help we can get.&quot;//

$q[**Quibas**]

Paula, Jennifer, and Vaclav are sitting in the shelter discussing the vote.

&quot;So, which way do we go? We&#39;re spoiled for choice,&quot; says Jennifer.

&quot;Well, we need to either hope that they&#39;re splitting the votes or that I can get Khall to flip,&quot; says Paula. &quot;I&#39;ve been trying with him because I think he&#39;s our best bet.&quot;

Jennifer and Vaclav share a pained glance.

&quot;...what?&quot;

//&quot;I&#39;m in a tough spot, but I have two ways out of here,&quot; says Paula. &quot;I have to at least do what&#39;s needed for both ways, and that is to find out what Khall sees and wants. He&#39;s more perceptive than people realize.&quot;//

&quot;So voting him or Jackie is probably out of the question, even though they both deserve it,&quot; says Jennifer.

&quot;Yeah, it could be Rocky or Denine again,&quot; Paula replies. &quot;It&#39;s not really up to us, though.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not happy that your plan relies on the most difficult player to read,&quot; says Vaclav.

&quot;Our only hope is that there&#39;s something that can help us that we&#39;re not seeing,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;Vaclav, you&#39;re voting with us no matter what, right?&quot;

Vaclav nods. &quot;I owe Paula for saving me, anyways.&quot;

&quot;Monty was the one who almost got voted out,&quot; says Paula. &quot;If anything, I owe you for making me not look stupid.&quot;

//&quot;I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll side with Paula,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;She was my friend, but I have friends on my new tribe now. I can&#39;t be hung up on old bonds, especially ones that I had trouble with, and tonight I might need to let go of one that I wanted to rely on.&quot;//

Meanwhile, Denine, Jackie, and Khall are talking by the riverbank.

&quot;So everything I said to Paula was a lie and I want her gone,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;Khall, I know you might like her, but I don&#39;t, and Denine doesn&#39;t so that&#39;s two against one.&quot;

Khall looks at Denine, who shrugs.

&quot;We couldn&#39;t compromise? I don&#39;t think she&#39;s the biggest threat,&quot; says Khall.

&quot;She&#39;s been trouble for us since day one,&quot; Jackie replies. &quot;You haven&#39;t forgotten her voting Tara out for no reason, have you?&quot;

&quot;No, no, of course not!&quot; Khall replies anxiously. &quot;I&#39;m just saying, are you not being a bit too rash?&quot;

&quot;Rocky&#39;s already on board for Paula,&quot; says Denine. &quot;And we don&#39;t know if Vaclav is going to chicken out.&quot;

//&quot;We should have the numbers tonight, but Vaclav was all about tribe unity last time I checked,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;To be sure, he should stick with us because then once Paula&#39;s gone we&#39;re all in the same alliance. I want Vaclav to be my third vote so I have control over Denine and Rocky.&quot;//

Elsewhere, Rocky has got a hold of Vaclav.

&quot;The chicks won&#39;t shut up about voting out Paula,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;Just join us and I&#39;ll make it worth your while.&quot;

&quot;Are you trying to threaten me?&quot; Vaclav asks.

&quot;No, just to bribe you,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;You&#39;re not the one who&#39;d hear the whining if it was only 4-3. They want to get to the merge with Jennifer as a get-out-of-jail-free card.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know if I can think that far ahead,&quot; says Vaclav.

//&quot;Seeing as that I&#39;m the only one here who can plan their way out of a paper bag,&quot; Rocky explains, &quot;I want to have some guy time with the nerd from the other tribe so he knows how much easier it will be for all of us if he just rolls with us. I&#39;m not trying to ruffle any of these sissies&#39; feathers, so if someone else can be the deciding vote instead of me then the heat&#39;s off me once again.&quot;//

Rocky is about to formulate a response, but someone comes up from behind and knocks him to the ground with a foot sweep. He cries out in pain, but his assailant talks over it.

&quot;Oh, quit your bellyaching,&quot; says Khall. &quot;I want to talk to this guy now.&quot;

Vaclav looks on in shock, but Khall continues talking. &quot;Jackie is really on me about voting out Paula. She thinks that I can&#39;t trust you.&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t trust anyone,&quot; says Vaclav.

&quot;Not even me? That&#39;s not very nice,&quot; Khall replies.

&quot;Sneak attacking me into the dirt wasn&#39;t very nice,&quot; Rocky groans.

//&quot;I&#39;ve been with Jackie since the very beginning,&quot; says Khall. &quot;Is it right of me to turn my back on her in her time of need? She would do the same for me, I think, but I don&#39;t know for sure. And if I break my word, would she ever forgive me? I can&#39;t go on this alone, not when almost everyone else has a partner in crime.&quot;//

&quot;What would you do,&quot; Khall asks, &quot;if you had to choose between keeping a promise and keeping a friend?&quot;

&quot;Whichever one was better for my game,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;And if you mean tonight... I&#39;m not sure yet, either.&quot;

&quot;Ergh...&quot; Rocky grunts, attempting to get up from his nasty fall. &quot;Just vote Paula...&quot;

$v[**Tribal Council**]

The Quibas tribe and Vaclav walk into the tribal council building. They place their lit torches behind their seats, and sit down in front.

$v[&quot;Welcome back, Quibas,&quot;] says Vincent. $v[&quot;I take it that things have been flipped around since last time, Rocky, or have they?&quot;]

&quot;Obviously,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;Last time they got cocky and tried to throw one of their own under the bus because of an idol that didn&#39;t exist. So now we have the guilty parties on the bottom where they belong.&quot;

&quot;And one of them is actually going,&quot; says Jackie. &quot;Because they had weak numbers, and we actually have a sturdy alliance. We even made sure we kidnapped someone to make it happen. I talked to Ashleia and Buddy, they didn&#39;t have the guts, so we have someone new here instead.&quot;

&quot;So all your talk about catching Rocky with his pants down was a total lie?&quot; Paula asks.

&quot;What, you didn&#39;t figure that out already?&quot; Jackie replies, with a smirk.

&quot;Oh, I knew it wasn&#39;t true,&quot; says Paula. &quot;I&#39;m just shocked that you&#39;re admitting it so suddenly.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just shocked that you knew you had no chance,&quot; says Jackie, &quot;and you still lost the challenge for us.&quot;

$v[&quot;Denine, as someone who was taking heat last time, do you think you&#39;re in the clear tonight?&quot;]

&quot;I think so,&quot; says Denine. &quot;Jennifer and Paula may be tight, but they&#39;re only two strong. The rest of us need to only take one of them out, and we won&#39;t make the same mistake of spreading ourselves thin like they did.&quot;

&quot;You do realize why we split last time,&quot; says Jennifer.

&quot;Do you have an idol?&quot; Denine asks.

&quot;That&#39;s classified,&quot; Jennifer replies.

Denine nods.

$v[&quot;Vaclav, you weren&#39;t here last time, and you&#39;re getting thrown into the mess left behind by an incredible blindside. Does this make this vote any different from a vote held before the lines are drawn?&quot;]

&quot;I&#39;m not sure whether I want to go with the flow or not,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;The consensus seems to be voting out Paula, but I don&#39;t have the choice to make it unanimous, it seems. Jennifer, you&#39;re still with Paula, right?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m doing exactly what I told you I would do,&quot; says Jennifer.

&quot;Care to elaborate?&quot; Rocky asks.

&quot;Why should I?&quot; Jennifer snaps. &quot;Being coy worked out well for you, mister hotshot.&quot;

Vaclav clears his throat. &quot;But I&#39;m not on this tribe. For me, there&#39;s no momentum to follow, I just have a vote that I can use to set the game up for myself.&quot;

&quot;Cryptic,&quot; says Denine.

$v[&quot;Jennifer, if Paula leaves tonight, that leaves you in a very bad spot. You don&#39;t sound like you&#39;re going to try to cut her loose for a better deal, so what can you do?&quot;]

&quot;Pleading my case,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;Vaclav, if you go back on your word just to look good to these morons, I will personally end you the first chance I get. You said it yourself, no momentum, so don&#39;t you dare take the cowardly way out.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t get scared by her,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;She&#39;s all split vote and no bite.&quot;

&quot;Shut up, Rocky!&quot;

$v[&quot;Khall, is there anything to be gained from turning on someone right after saving them?&quot;]

&quot;Not a lot,&quot; says Khall, &quot;but I don&#39;t want to do that.&quot;

Jennifer grits her teeth in annoyance, while Denine smirks.

&quot;Because last time I saved Denine!&quot; Khall exclaims. &quot;And she&#39;s not who I&#39;m voting for!&quot;

&quot;We know you aren&#39;t, what&#39;s your point?&quot; says Jackie. &quot;Come on, I want to get to the good part.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m voting you out.&quot;

Paula looks over at Jennifer and Vaclav, completely stunned. Denine&#39;s smirk fades away.

&quot;By &#39;you&#39;, you mean Paula,&quot; says Jackie.

&quot;No, I mean you, Jackie. I&#39;m voting against you tonight.&quot; Khall crosses his arms. &quot;I&#39;ve had enough of you bossing me around. You don&#39;t listen to my ideas, and whenever I come up with something smart you overrule me with something stupid.&quot;

&quot;Stupid? Now isn&#39;t that ironic!&quot; Jackie snaps.

&quot;It&#39;s not ironic,&quot; says Jennifer.

&quot;I warned you that I didn&#39;t want Paula out, that we could be doing something else,&quot; says Khall. &quot;But you let your petty rivalry get in the way, and tried to guilt me into just following along!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve been your best friend all game, since Paula voted out your other best friend!&quot; Jackie yells. &quot;Does that not mean anything to you? Do you think she will defend you the way I&#39;ve defended you? Now before you do anything **petty**, you should stick with where the numbers are and vote Paula out!&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t know numbers!&quot; Khall snaps. &quot;Your plans were always doomed to fail! Do you think Rocky and Denine care for you at all? We&#39;re a means to an end for them, and I thought you would have figured that out by now! And if I can&#39;t convince you that following them down into the pits of nobody-likes-you is a bad idea, then I need to cut my losses!&quot;

&quot;Hell yeah!&quot; Jennifer and Paula cheer.

&quot;No, that&#39;s wrong!&quot; Jackie turns to Denine and Rocky. &quot;You guys know I am one hundred percent with you. We still have the numbers, we can do this!&quot;

Denine nods. &quot;Do you still want to do Paula? Or try switching to-&quot;

Rocky scoffs. &quot;Fat chance! You think you&#39;re going to catch me on this sinking ship?&quot;

&quot;Sinking ship!?&quot; Jackie snaps.

&quot;You and Khall were a package deal,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;And now he wants nothing to do with you. The tables have turned, and I&#39;m not going to be on the losing side by sticking up for a backstabber.&quot;

&quot;What the hell, Rocky?&quot; Denine glares. &quot;Right now we don&#39;t have the liberty to choose our allies.&quot;

&quot;Khall does,&quot; says Rocky. He leans in to whisper to Denine. &quot;So we have to save face. I suggest you switch your vote to Jackie as well, if you want me as your meat shield and not the other way around.&quot;

Jackie looks over at Vaclav. &quot;Please... you need to give me immunity. You want to keep the tribe together, don&#39;t you? We need to shake the game up.&quot;

Vaclav appears deep in thought. Jackie, meanwhile, winks to Denine. Denine winks back, but immediately turns to cover her face with her hands.

&quot;Don&#39;t fall for it,&quot; says Paula. &quot;It&#39;s a distraction. Keep it and put her out of her misery.&quot;

&quot;I promise I won&#39;t vote for you if you give me immunity,&quot; Jackie replies.

$v[&quot;Vaclav, what are you going to do? Will you give up your immunity?&quot;]
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Vaclav sighs. &quot;Jackie. Do you swear that giving immunity to you won&#39;t send me home?&quot;

Jackie nods. &quot;I&#39;m sure of it. I swear.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t buy it. Let&#39;s vote.&quot;

Jackie&#39;s jaw drops, and her face begins turning ghostly white.

$v[&quot;That&#39;s settled, then. Paula, you&#39;re up first.&quot;]

...

Jennifer casts her vote for **Jackie**. &quot;Oh, how the whiny has fallen. Nice knowing you, hoe.&quot;

Jackie casts her vote for **Paula**. &quot;You suck. You suck soooooo much. Everything that&#39;s gone wrong with this tribe has been your fault. You lost the challenge today, you&#39;re in the minority, you should be going home today. I HATE you, Paula! You suck! And tell Jennifer that she sucks too! You both suck, and Khall sucks, and Vaclav sucks, and Rocky sucks. I hope this camp burns to the ground! I deserve better than this, and how dare you all do this to me! Go to hell, all of you, but especially you, Paula!&quot;

&lt;br&gt;
$v[&quot;First vote... &#39;Paulawful.&#39; Ooookay. One vote for Paula.&quot;]

&quot;So mature,&quot; says Paula.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$v[&quot;Second vote is for Jackie.&quot;]

Jackie folds her arms, scowling.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$v[&quot;Jackie.&quot;]

Rocky nudges Denine, who pushes him away.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$v[&quot;Jackie. Three votes for Jackie, one vote for Paula.&quot;]

Khall gives a thumbs up to Jennifer on his right side, then to Vaclav on his left.

&quot;You actually disgust me,&quot; says Jackie.

$v[&quot;Fifth vote... **Jackie**. That&#39;s four, that&#39;s enough, you are the seventh $boot. You need to bring me your torch.&quot;]

Everyone looks happy with the results, except for Jackie and Denine.

Jackie looks over at Denine before getting up. &quot;Don&#39;t pout, you&#39;re the one who didn&#39;t have the guts to stick up for me. You&#39;re not getting my coat.&quot;

&quot;Thanks for playing,&quot; says Jennifer.

Jackie shoves her torch into the slot in front of Vincent, who is waiting with a torch snuffer. $v[&quot;Jackie, the tribe has spoken.&quot;]

&quot;And I hope they never speak again,&quot; says Jackie, as she watches her torch get extinguished with dramatic music playing overhead.

$v[&quot;It&#39;s time for you to go.&quot;]

Jackie marches out of the tribal council building, arms completely straight as she sways them back and forth. Her hands are on the verge of clenching into fists.

$v[&quot;No matter how solid a plan seems,&quot;] says Vincent, $v[&quot;the winds of change can come and blow anyone out of the game. You can never be sure when those winds may come. You can head back to camp.&quot;]
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$q[&quot;That was so unfair,&quot; says Jackie, still scowling. &quot;I made a great move last time, and I expected the others to listen to me, but then I get stabbed in the back by **Khall** of all people? I trusted them to do the right thing and vote Paula out, and they crushed my heart! They don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing, and it&#39;s going to come back to haunt them, and I won&#39;t be feeling sorry! At least I got... no, they wouldn&#39;t even let me get farther than my stupid sister!&quot; She pulls her forearms in front of her face and screams in frustration.]

&quot;You made the right decision,&quot; says Paula to the others. &quot;You saw her back there, she was having a complete meltdown.&quot;

&quot;That only made it easier,&quot; Vaclav replies. &quot;I can&#39;t believe she would make a play for my immunity.&quot;

Khall shakes his head. &quot;I was afraid you&#39;d give it up.&quot;

The rest of the tribe stays silent.

//&quot;Once I saw that Paula had the votes to stick around, I knew what I had to do,&quot; Rocky explains. &quot;I don&#39;t have any loyalty to anyone here. Sticking to my plan would have put me on the losing side, and I&#39;m not someone who likes to lose.&quot;//

The group quickly disperses into pairs to discuss their game plans. Jennifer and Paula walk back to camp by themselves, talking along the way.

&quot;You definitely shocked me there,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;I was already thinking about just aligning with Vaclav and flipping at the merge. Good job on actually getting Khall to flip.&quot;

&quot;Well, thanks,&quot; says Paula. &quot;It wasn&#39;t all me, though, I think he just didn&#39;t want to admit to himself that he had to change his ways.&quot;

&quot;But do you think you can keep him?&quot;

Paula looks confused. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;If he can turn on allies so easily, what makes you think that he won&#39;t do it to you?&quot; Jennifer asks.

//&quot;There&#39;s only five of us, now,&quot; says Jennifer, &quot;and normally that would be enough to hold together and take out the outsiders. But with the kidnapping twist, and the fact that Khall is unreadable, suddenly he&#39;s a lot less useful. There&#39;s a fifty-fifty chance that he&#39;ll go right back to Rocky and Denine in my mind, and that&#39;s not going to fly.&quot;//

&quot;Well, right now, I&#39;m all that he has left,&quot; says Paula. &quot;I don&#39;t want to betray him. I&#39;d rather not pass judgment until he tells us what he wants to do from here.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t trust it,&quot; Jennifer replies. &quot;Tonight was the first time he voted your way.&quot;

&quot;Maybe he finally saw the light,&quot; says Paula. &quot;Jackie was supposedly his partner in crime, and he chose me over her.&quot;

&quot;The two of you put him between a rock and a hard place,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;Next time, though, they&#39;re not going to go after you. It&#39;s going to be me or one of our allies, and do you really think Khall is about to completely change his tone and play your game to the letter?&quot;

//&quot;I owe Khall a lot after tonight,&quot; says Paula. &quot;I put my faith in him, and he pulled through for me, and I appreciate that. Just because I&#39;m not willing to treat him like a pawn who has now served his purpose doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m bowing to his will or anything... I don&#39;t even know what his will is!&quot;//

Khall stays behind to talk with Vaclav.

&quot;And with that begins the next chapter of my game,&quot; says Khall.

&quot;Of everyone&#39;s game, really,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;We&#39;ve been here 20 days, there are only 19 left until the end.&quot;

&quot;I just meant that I&#39;m not under anyone&#39;s shadow anymore,&quot; Khall replies.

&quot;Okay.&quot; Vaclav keeps his head forward, not saying anything else.

Khall looks up at Vaclav, noticing a lack of expression. &quot;Hey, are you mad at me?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not,&quot; Vaclav replies.

&quot;You&#39;re being quieter than usual,&quot; says Khall. &quot;Are you upset about how the vote turned out?&quot;

&quot;No, she needed to go,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;It was not the right time to do anything else.&quot;

//&quot;Last night was a little too easy,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;Khall turned the entire tribe around, when he could have just kept his head down and pulled off a blindside. We all voted for Jackie, though. The battle lines are gone. Where do I go from here?&quot;//

&quot;What&#39;s your plan?&quot; Vaclav asks. &quot;What made you turn on Jackie?&quot;

&quot;I already gave my reasons,&quot; says Khall. &quot;Everything I said to her was the truth. I wasn&#39;t doing myself any favours being where I was.&quot;

&quot;So it was entirely out of spite?&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#39;t out of spite.&quot; Khall poses heroically. &quot;It was out of justice.&quot;

//&quot;Not everything has to be some big scheme to make the end,&quot; Khall explains. &quot;Sometimes I do things because it just feels right. I can&#39;t help if that&#39;s an issue for some people. It&#39;s just the way I am.&quot;//

Meanwhile, Denine and Rocky walk back to camp not far behind their female tribemates.

&quot;I can&#39;t even look at you right now,&quot; says Denine. &quot;We didn&#39;t need to flip, and now we&#39;re down two numbers. Not one, but TWO!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d rather lose numbers than lose a vote,&quot; Rocky replies. &quot;Jackie was dead weight. Don&#39;t tell me you feel bad for her, do you?&quot;

&quot;Not really,&quot; says Denine.

&quot;Good. Neither do I. I do kind of pity her, though, because for all that time she thought she was the one in control.&quot; Rocky shrugs.

&quot;Irrelevant,&quot; Denine snaps. &quot;Now, look at who actually has the power on this tribe. That&#39;s right, Jennifer does! This is a worst case scenario.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s not a threat to us,&quot; Rocky replies. &quot;I have an idol, and she clearly doesn&#39;t. The day she actually does something beyond just talk will be the day that I take her seriously.&quot;

//&quot;The thing about these amateurs is that they&#39;re all showing their hands too early,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;I&#39;m getting a hang of how everyone operates. I see who&#39;s really playing the game, and who&#39;s just a mouth. I&#39;m going to figure out how to pick off the real dangers without giving the mouths any credit.&quot;//

$c[**Chalpe**]

As Vaclav returns back to camp, and his solemn expression confuses the rest of his tribe.

&quot;What happened?&quot; Candace asks. &quot;I can sense your feelings of isolation from here.&quot;

&quot;You didn&#39;t get blindsided, did you?&quot; Louie asks.

Vaclav shakes his head. &quot;I am fine. Everything is fine.&quot;

&quot;Everything&#39;s not fine,&quot; says Rhett.

&quot;What do you mean? Is something wrong?&quot; Vaclav asks.

&quot;You&#39;re asking //us?//&quot; Ashleia asks, stunned. &quot;You look like you just got dumped via text message.&quot;

&quot;Maybe I am just stressed,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;We all voted Jackie, and she was really angry about it. And now, I don&#39;t know if they are going to stick together or not.&quot;

//&quot;Vaclav got me thinking,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;I mean, if they can come together now, does that mean they&#39;re going to stay together? If they do, then we need to merge up in numbers. More importantly, like, is this tribe going to stick together?&quot;//

&quot;I think, like, we should stick together as well,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;There are five of them, there are six of us. We have the numbers, but if they think they&#39;re going to flip one of us, then being six strong is our only hope.&quot;

&quot;What if they turn on each other?&quot; Buddy asks.

&quot;Then that&#39;s good news for us, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Louie replies. &quot;We wipe the floor with them.&quot;

&quot;If we merge tomorrow, and one of you guys flip right away,&quot; says Candace, &quot;you&#39;ve lost my jury vote. I&#39;m not even joking. Even if they say &#39;oh you can vote one of our old tribe next time&#39;, call their bluff!&quot;

//&quot;I don&#39;t see any problem with Ashleia&#39;s plan,&quot; says Louie. &quot;Well, there&#39;s one major problem. I don&#39;t want Buddy around more than I need him. I&#39;d rather get Denine to jump ship to take him out, or at least keep me company.&quot;//

&quot;Rocky doesn&#39;t deserve to have made it this far,&quot; says Rhett. Upon mention of Rocky, Louie rolls his eyes. &quot;Even if his whole tribe bails him out, we have the numbers to do something about it. We can get vengeance for everyone he&#39;s gotten out of here. It can be the six of us to the end.&quot;

&quot;If that&#39;s your motivation, then okay,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;We can&#39;t just go for just Rocky, though. They each cast one vote, after all.&quot;

&quot;It needs to be our number one priority,&quot; Rhett replies.

&quot;What about all the people that spoiled the split vote plan?&quot; Vaclav asks. &quot;If Rocky wins immunity, that&#39;s an option.&quot;

&quot;Then we just can&#39;t let him get immunity,&quot; says Rhett.

Buddy shakes his head. &quot;If it&#39;s an endurance challenge, good luck.&quot;

//&quot;Once again, everything is about Rocky with him,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;If it will get him to snap out of it and move on, by all means, I&#39;ll vote Rocky out. But I don&#39;t like the idea of having five whole votes dictated for me; I&#39;m not reaching the end on someone else&#39;s plan. At some point I&#39;m going to jump off, and pick a path I make myself. Preferably with Paula and not Louie.&quot;//

$q[**Quibas**]

While Denine is filling up her water flask, she is approached by Jennifer, carrying her own flask.

&quot;Hey, Denine, can I talk to you for a second?&quot; Jennifer asks.

Denine takes a breath before responding. &quot;Yes, you can.&quot;

&quot;How close are you, actually, with Rocky?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s an alliance of necessity, and you know that,&quot; Denine replies.

&quot;I just remember you having a bit of a quarrel with him last night after Khall said he was going to flip,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;He doesn&#39;t respect you, just like nobody respects him.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well, but he&#39;s convinced I need him, and that I&#39;m an extra vote for him,&quot; says Denine. &quot;Of course, the reality being everyone and their grandma can beat him in a final two.&quot;

//&quot;I&#39;m not totally fixed on the idea of bringing Rocky to the end, because it means 20 more days of Rocky,&quot; Denine explains. &quot;Right now, though, I have a fairly small circle. I&#39;m not relying on things staying exactly how they are now. If there&#39;s someone I can use, and they&#39;re not in danger, I&#39;m going to try and keep using them.&quot;//

&quot;Denine, you&#39;re tight with Louie and you&#39;re seemingly tight with Rocky,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;You&#39;re in two tight pairs, and that&#39;s not really a good position to be in.&quot;

&quot;There are definitely better targets out there right now,&quot; Denine counters. &quot;Everyone knows how annoying and possibly dangerous Rocky is. If the tide turns against him and he can&#39;t do anything for me, suddenly I&#39;m not in two pairs anymore.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s not doing anything for you right now at all.&quot; Jennifer looks Denine in the eyes. &quot;Rocky isn&#39;t your meal ticket. You know that if this is really the best strategy, someone will come in and try to steal him away from you. Next thing you know, you&#39;re on the jury and your goat is at the end without you.&quot;

&quot;The jury hasn&#39;t even started yet, Jen.&quot; Denine caps her flask. &quot;And he&#39;s not the only one who isn&#39;t doing anything for us.&quot;

&quot;And who might you be referring to?&quot; Jennifer asks, eyebrow raised.

&quot;I&#39;m talking about Khall,&quot; says Denine. &quot;We both know we can&#39;t really understand him, let alone trust him. You didn&#39;t even know he was going to vote with you until halfway through tribal. Do you like strategizing on the edge of your seat?&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s with me right now. I&#39;m not going to treat him the way Jackie did.&quot;

&quot;He has a weaker bond with you than he did Jackie,&quot; says Denine. &quot;Come to think of it... does anyone really have a bond with him?&quot;

//&quot;Jackie and Khall were a duo for as long as I can remember,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;But Khall turned on her. Lucky for us, but that kind of throws everything I know about Khall out the window. His casual conversations always result in more questions than answers. He&#39;s on a completely different wavelength. But is he really not involved with the game? That, I&#39;m not sure if I can answer.&quot;//

&quot;I think it&#39;s time we head back,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;I have a feeling that we&#39;re going to get treemail soon.&quot;

&quot;If it&#39;s another immunity challenge, I&#39;m probably going to scream,&quot; says Denine.

Jennifer shrugs. &quot;I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be that unlucky.&quot;

$t[**Town Square**]

The five members of Quibas arrive at the Town Square, where they see the six members of Chalpe waiting for them, sitting around several baskets of food sitting on the green tarp formerly used in Ochora&#39;s shelter.

&quot;What took you so long?&quot; says Louie. &quot;We&#39;re dying to eat over here.&quot;

&quot;You poor thing, you must have been suffering,&quot; Denine replies, sitting down next to him. &quot;Do we need to call the medic?&quot;

&quot;Denine,&quot; says Louie, &quot;for the past three weeks I&#39;ve felt like I have that one condition where you&#39;re so hungry that your stomach bloats.&quot;

&quot;Nope, you&#39;re just fat,&quot; says Rocky.

&quot;Your rack is bigger than mine, Louie,&quot; Denine adds.

&quot;Nobody needed to hear that,&quot; snaps Buddy.

//&quot;It smells like the merge is finally here,&quot; says Louie. &quot;About time, too. I was getting sick and tired of the least annoying person around being Vaclav. And now there should be enough people here that they&#39;ll let me sink into the background and pull strings that way.&quot;//

&quot;So, Ash,&quot; says Candace, &quot;do you wish to partake? You better jump in there if you don&#39;t want someone to snag your share.&quot;

Ashleia nods, grabs a plate, and begins assembling a sandwich. &quot;This is a well-balanced meal, Candace. I just wouldn&#39;t have that much bread.&quot;

&quot;Food is energy,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;Energy is strength.&quot;

&quot;Which is why I&#39;m eating now,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;I don&#39;t get what you&#39;re trying to say.&quot;

//&quot;I want to try and connect with people, but instead I&#39;m getting talked to about my diet,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;It&#39;s totally rude. I&#39;m making smart choices so I can continue to look good and feel good. That&#39;s important for me, because I don&#39;t want to sacrifice my well-being for this game.&quot;//

Khall nudges Paula with his elbow. &quot;Am I the only one who feels... a little bad about celebrating so soon?&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; says Paula. &quot;We don&#39;t know for sure it&#39;s the merge yet.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s true,&quot; Khall replies. &quot;But I meant, only last night we had a vote where a lot of people were frustrated.&quot;

&quot;I know, but the game goes on.&quot; Paula takes a bite of chicken, chews, and swallows before speaking again. &quot;Besides, you did it to save me, didn&#39;t you?&quot;

Khall nods. &quot;I know. I just feel a little bit bad for Jamie. She left without any friends.&quot;

Paula nearly chokes on her next bite. &quot;Jamie!? Who&#39;s that?&quot;

&quot;The girl we just voted out.&quot;

//&quot;I don&#39;t always remember every little detail about everyone I meet,&quot; Khall explains. &quot;It&#39;s not really their fault, it&#39;s just not everything I&#39;m told is relevant to the plot.&quot;//

&quot;I guess you didn&#39;t care for her much after all,&quot; says Paula.

&quot;Not after I saw the real Jamie,&quot; Khall replies. &quot;But that&#39;s not really important anymore,&quot; he whispers. &quot;I promise I&#39;ll be on your side, no matter what. You, me, and Buddy, final three. What do you say?&quot;

&quot;I-I mean, I&#39;m not against the idea,&quot; Paula whispers back. &quot;But I-&quot;

**&quot;Don&#39;t touch that!&quot;**

Khall and Paula look over to see who had the sudden outburst. Vaclav was staring down Buddy, who had his hand near a bottle with a note inside.

&quot;That&#39;s going to end the feast, and probably throw in some kind of weird twist that completely ruins our day,&quot; says Vaclav.

&quot;You could just say you&#39;re not done,&quot; says Buddy.

&quot;It might not be the merge, it could be worse than that!&quot;

Jennifer looks at Vaclav, confused. &quot;What, are you afraid it&#39;s going to release some kind of supervirus?&quot;

Rhett&#39;s eyes snap open. &quot;For all we know, it could do that!&quot;

//&quot;We had a good meal in front of us, that&#39;s something we&#39;ve all been wanting for almost a month,&quot; says Vaclav, &quot;and some people were just so eager to get back to the game that they were rushing me to finish, it seemed! I just knew that the bottle was going to take that away from me. All I wanted was just one moment of relief from the lies and deception... and also cheese.&quot;//

Once Vaclav finished, Buddy opens up the bottle and removes the note inside.

&quot;You have now reached the end of many things,&quot; Buddy reads. &quot;This feast, your time spent in two camps... and this very meeting ground.&quot;

&quot;This meeting ground, as in where we&#39;re sitting?&quot; Candace asks.

&quot;Congratulations on making the merge,&quot; Buddy continues. &quot;Drop your buffs, and bring your torches to the Quibas camp, where if you are lucky, you will live for the next eighteen days.&quot;

&quot;I hope that&#39;s it,&quot; says Vaclav.

&quot;It better be,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;Let&#39;s go before the bones and table scraps start to smell.&quot;

$m[**Former Quibas Camp**]

Not long after getting to their new camp, a group of six players gathers by the tribe flag to pick a tribe name.

&quot;It should be something simple,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;Something we can write down on the new banner.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s our new tribe colour, anyways? Red?&quot; Candace looks down at the buff around her neck. &quot;Yeah, red.&quot;

&quot;We could pick something that means red...&quot; Ashleia suggests.

&quot;In what? Spanish?&quot; Buddy shakes his head. &quot;*Too* simple.&quot;

&quot;Do we have any running gags or inside jokes that we can call our tribe?&quot; Khall asks.

Vaclav glares at Khall.

&quot;What&#39;s wr-&quot;

&quot;I know what you are thinking of,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;We will not name our tribe that.&quot;

//&quot;You know, I hadn&#39;t even said anything yet,&quot; says Khall, &quot;and Vaclav shoots me down. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s gotten into him, but he&#39;s forgotten how to not be serious. I can&#39;t say I&#39;m very happy about that.&quot;//

&quot;We could just combine all the tribe names into one,&quot; says Paula. &quot;Quichalpora, maybe.&quot;

&quot;I like that idea,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;Bit unwieldy, though.&quot;

The group plays around with other combinations of their old tribe names.

&quot;Ochalibas!&quot; Ashleia says at last.

&quot;I love it!&quot; Paula replies.

&quot;Let&#39;s write that down,&quot; says Candace. &quot;Where&#39;s the paint?&quot;

&quot;Rocky had it,&quot; Vaclav replies. &quot;He said he wanted to &#39;liven up the joint&#39;. What did he mean by that?&quot;

&quot;Whatever it is, I don&#39;t like the sound of it.&quot; Candace looks around. &quot;Say, where is he?&quot;

Everyone shrugs.

&quot;Never where you want him to be,&quot; says Candace. &quot;Do any of you guys have a problem with voting him out if we lose?&quot;

//&quot;If everyone has had as much of a problem with Rocky as I have,&quot; Candace explains, &quot;then we have a straightforward vote. All I need to do is convince Rocky I&#39;ll save him with my idol. If we can do that, then we can all move on.&quot;//

&quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; says Buddy.

&quot;I can go for that,&quot; Paula agrees. &quot;We aren&#39;t close.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s fine,&quot; says Vaclav.

&quot;Alright, let&#39;s get the paint for the banner.&quot; Candace walks off with Vaclav.

&quot;Rhett&#39;s on board, it&#39;s all he&#39;s talked about for the past week,&quot; Buddy explains to Paula and Khall. &quot;So we should have seven votes at least, depending on who else we can get. We can work things out after he&#39;s gone.&quot;

//&quot;I still have a deal with Paula and I will never go back on it,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;So for now, I&#39;m just making sure I can steer the rest of my alliance away from her and towards people that tried to vote her out last time. When someone needs the leftover Quibas numbers to make a move, I&#39;ll be there, too.&quot;//

Denine and Louie are sitting in the shelter, which had never been expanded for more than six people.

&quot;So this is where you&#39;ve been for the past ten days?&quot; Louie asks.

&quot;Sucks, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; Denine replies.

&quot;Well, I hadn&#39;t even commented on it yet, but sure.&quot; Louie coughs. &quot;I&#39;m just tired of being around those people I was stuck with. Say the word and I&#39;ll flip.&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t trust my old tribe either,&quot; says Denine. &quot;We pulled off a beautiful blindside with Monty, and then Khall ruined the NEW majority because his feelings were hurt or whatever. I only voted Jackie out to save my own ass.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have any ass to save,&quot; says Louie.

&quot;You shut your food hole, Stay-Puft.&quot;

//&quot;I don&#39;t have a plan,&quot; says Louie. &quot;In this game, I never do. The one constant is Denine, because she&#39;s committed to keeping me around. Can&#39;t fault her for what I want her to do, though.&quot;//

&quot;Well, if we can&#39;t trust those guys, the only one I can really try to pull in is Vaclav,&quot; Louie explains. &quot;He&#39;s not really as emotionally unstable as he was before, but he doesn&#39;t like when things are too simple. He&#39;s a prime flipper.&quot;

&quot;And it pains me to say this,&quot; says Denine, &quot;but the only one I have left on my side is Rocky.&quot;

&quot;Whatever happened to despising him and everything he stands for?&quot; Louie asks.

&quot;You can blame Jennifer for that,&quot; says Denine. &quot;She wanted to suck up to the majority and wouldn&#39;t let me get a word in. When I told her what was what, she threw me under the bus. She couldn&#39;t handle that I had a backbone.&quot;

&quot;So Rocky of all people is the one guy you haven&#39;t somehow burned,&quot; says Louie. &quot;Way to go, girl.&quot; He smirks, but in a way suggesting it&#39;s at Denine&#39;s expense and not in support of her.

//&quot;So if I get Louie and Rocky with me, and Louie gets in Vaclav, that&#39;s still only four votes,&quot; says Denine. &quot;If they split the vote perfectly, we still lose. So most likely, one of the other seven has to go, because I&#39;m not losing two allies in a row.&quot;//

Elsewhere, Jennifer and Rhett are catching up and putting together a game plan.

&quot;So your tribe wants to get rid of Rocky? All of them?&quot; Jennifer asks.

&quot;I believe so,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;It&#39;s hard to take them seriously because of some of them have chosen to NOT do that in the past.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s talk this out,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;Paula will definitely side with us. I&#39;m trying to tell Denine keeping him is a bad move, and Khall is a big question mark. Who&#39;s on your side?&quot;

&quot;Candace says she doesn&#39;t like Rocky, but has never voted against him, so we can&#39;t count on her,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;Louie doesn&#39;t like anyone. You know who nobody likes? Rocky. They&#39;re a perfect fit, so he&#39;s out. Buddy told me we can&#39;t just focus on voting Rocky, so he has plans to keep him. Vaclav is too flighty, Rocky will use that to flip him. And I just don&#39;t have a good feeling about Ashleia.&quot;

&quot;So... nobody.&quot; Jennifer crosses her arms.

&quot;We need to watch them, make sure Rocky doesn&#39;t get a chance to flip any of them.&quot;

&quot;No need to worry. I&#39;m right here!&quot;

Rhett turns around, becoming face to face with Rocky, and screams.

&quot;Seriously, Rocky! Do you ever learn?&quot; Jennifer protests.

&quot;Of course I know not to interrupt people,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;I just choose not to. Polite and structured conversation gets dry after a little while.&quot;

//&quot;Survivor is a game about adapting,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;You have to adapt all the time, and if you can&#39;t, then you lose. So why not force some chaos on these people? If they can&#39;t adapt to that... well...&quot; Rocky grins.//

&quot;This is a conversation we want to have without you,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;So leave while you still can.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s so important that you don&#39;t want me to know?&quot; Rocky asks.

&quot;You know, based on what you know about us, and how much you screwed me over, you should know exactly what we&#39;re talking about,&quot; Jennifer replies.

&quot;Maybe I just want to make sure!&quot; Rocky protests. &quot;What&#39;s your problem?&quot;

&quot;You are!&quot; Jennifer and Rhett yell at the same time.

//&quot;Rocky skulking around like an unwanted party guest is driving me up the wall,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;It&#39;s not doing him any favours, the only thing it&#39;s going to get him is a bad case of these hands.&quot;//

&quot;Well, if you guys want to play the same old &#39;Rocky&#39;s a big fat meanie&#39; routine like a bunch of chumps,&quot; says Rocky, &quot;well that&#39;s fine! But I&#39;m not going anywhere.&quot;

&quot;Then stay right here and whine,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;It won&#39;t change anything. I want nothing to do with you. You&#39;re a stupid, insecure wannabe who doesn&#39;t deserve jack. Now don&#39;t you dare follow me!&quot; She storms off.

&quot;She&#39;s the insecure one,&quot; Rocky says to Rhett.

&quot;I don&#39;t need your opinion, Rocky.&quot; Rhett spits on the ground between them. &quot;I know what you are.  I&#39;m not letting you get away with it.&quot;

//&quot;Rocky seems to know exactly when and where people are plotting against him,&quot; Rhett insists. &quot;It&#39;s no coincidence. It&#39;s more than that. And you better believe that I, Rhett Mason, will uncover the truth and take down Rocky&#39;s malicious plot.&quot;//

Immunity Challenge**

The tribe of eleven walks into the challenge area, each sporting a red buff somewhere on their person.

$v[&quot;It&#39;s now time for your first immunity challenge as a single tribe. I&#39;ll take back the tribal immunity idol, as it is no longer valid,&quot;] says Vincent. He takes back the idol from Louie, and puts it underneath a podium. $v[&quot;Today, only one of you will be safe from the vote. This is what you&#39;re competing for.&quot;] He pulls a blanket off the top of the podium, revealing a large pendant made of earth-toned ceramic beads. A gold-plated trinket with a yellow gemstone embedded inside hangs from the center of the pendant. $v[&quot;Whoever is wearing this at tribal council cannot have votes cast against them, and the only way to guarantee you have it tonight is to win this challenge.&quot;]

Each contestant must stand inside a wooden frame. They have to balance on their toes in order to hold a wooden block upright between the top of the frame and their head. If a contestant lets their block drop, or touches either side of their frame, they are out of the challenge. Last one standing wins immunity.

Everyone takes to balancing fairly easily, at first. Candace clasps her hands together and begins to hum, and Rocky grumbles.

Paula falls after only a couple minutes. Not long after, Louie&#39;s heels sink, and his block falls. The remaining nine remain steady, none of them making much noise... except for Candace.

(colour: purple + white)[&quot;I&#39;ve got the world at my feet... success has been so easy for me...&quot;] Candace whispers to herself. (colour: purple + white)[&quot;It&#39;s me who put me where I am now...&quot;]

&quot;Not this again,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;$100 goes to whoever can get her to stop that.&quot;

Candace&#39;s eyebrows furrow, but she remains still. (colour: purple + white)[&quot;I know you can&#39;t believe it when you hear that I won&#39;t see you,&quot;] she says, just loud enough for Rocky to hear.

&quot;What does that even mean?&quot; Rocky asks angrily, not really caring for an answer.

(colour: purple + white)[&quot;I know you don&#39;t believe me when I say that I don&#39;t need you...&quot;]

&quot;Okay! Okay! I give!&quot; Rocky jumps down with force, grabs his block before it falls, and chucks it across the beach. &quot;Just shut up already!&quot;

Candace&#39;s face returns to a relaxed expression. (colour: purple + white)[&quot;I don&#39;t want you, Rocky... I don&#39;t want you, ohhh-o-o-ohhh...&quot;]

Rhett begins to struggle, but manages to correct himself and keep his block from falling.

The next to have their block drop is Khall. He steps down and sighs.

A little while later, Vaclav begins to have trouble balancing his block. He squirms to try and keep it centred, though as he does so, Jennifer loses her balance and her block falls.

Rhett has a bit of a wobble, but this time is unable to recover. His block falls. Shortly after, Vaclav unwittingly holds his elbow against the frame to prop himself up as he moves his block back into position. He is caught by Vincent, and disqualified.

&quot;Hey, Candace,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;Care to cut a deal?&quot;

&quot;With four people still left?&quot; Denine asks. &quot;Are you nuts? Or have you already counted the rest of us out?&quot;

&quot;Well, you wouldn&#39;t really know,&quot; says Buddy, &quot;but when Candace gets in the zone, she is-&quot;

$v[&quot;Ashleia&#39;s block has dropped. We are down to three!&quot;]

&quot;If we don&#39;t do something, neither of us is winning immunity,&quot; Buddy continues. &quot;Candace will have this in the bag. And from the way things are shaping out, I&#39;m not the one who&#39;s going to be missing it.&quot;

&quot;Is that a threat?&quot; says Denine.

&quot;It&#39;s an observation,&quot; Buddy replies. &quot;Who has the majority right now?&quot;

Denine doesn&#39;t respond.

After a little while of silence, Buddy answers his own question. &quot;If you honestly don&#39;t know, it&#39;s probably not you.&quot;

&quot;If I need this more than you,&quot; says Denine, &quot;then drop.&quot;

&quot;Not while Candace is still in,&quot; Buddy replies.

During the entire exchange, Candace does not say a word, and barely moves at all.

Many minutes later, a particularly strong gust of wind comes in. It shakes everyone&#39;s frames slightly. Candace and Denine are able to adjust, but Buddy overcorrects and his block falls. When Buddy steps down, he nearly instantly falls to his knees.

Denine takes a deep breath, in an attempt to steady herself, but ends up swaying ever so slightly backwards. She is unable to pull herself back upright, and falls backwards out of the frame.

Vincent raises his arms, making the V for Victory sign with both hands. $v[&quot;Candace wins individual immunity!&quot;] he shouts.

Candace steps down, breaking her trance, and catching her wooden block before it hits the ground. &quot;Oh, good... I&#39;m starting to see funny colours.&quot; Most of the contestants out of the challenge clap and cheer for Candace.

Vincent gestures Candace over to him, and places the immunity necklace around her neck. $v[&quot;Candace, immunity is yours. Congratulations, you are safe tonight, and have guaranteed yourself a spot in the final ten.&quot;]

&quot;I have found favour with the energies of this land,&quot; says Candace.

&quot;You have found a way to be even more annoying,&quot; says Rocky.

$v[&quot;The rest of you will see me tonight at tribal council, where one of you will be the eighth person voted out. You can head back to camp.&quot;]

$m[**Ochalibas**]

//&quot;Candace won immunity, which is good because I wasn&#39;t targeting her,&quot; says Paula. &quot;All my options are still open. This is the first time I really get to see what Buddy sees, so I wanted to see if I could get some insight from him.&quot;//

&quot;Right now,&quot; says Buddy to Paula, &quot;my old tribe wants to just vote out your old tribe one by one.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s probably the worst case scenario for me,&quot; says Paula.

&quot;Tell me about it. But it&#39;s not all bad,&quot; Buddy explains, &quot;right now all eyes are on Rocky. Is your old tribe sticking together?&quot;

&quot;Not at all,&quot; says Paula. &quot;All ties are severed. I&#39;m down to vote out Rocky tonight.&quot;

&quot;I have a better idea!&quot;

Buddy and Paula look up and see Khall, hanging from a high tree branch by only his hands. He jumps down.

&quot;What are you...?&quot; Buddy begins, but Paula puts out her hand to stop him.

&quot;Khall is with me,&quot; says Paula. &quot;See, now we have eight votes against Rocky.&quot;

&quot;But what if we want someone else out?&quot; Khall suggests. &quot;I think now would be a good time to make a move against Vaclav.&quot;

Paula&#39;s face nearly goes pale.

&quot;We don&#39;t have close to the amount of votes we need,&quot; says Buddy.

&quot;Not quite,&quot; Khall replies, &quot;but is eight against three smart?&quot;

//&quot;Has everyone forgotten about idols?&quot; Khall asks rhetorically. &quot;Everyone says they&#39;re voting Rocky. This has been tried three times. Rocky has more reason to look for an idol than anyone. And if he has it, then why should Rocky decide who goes instead?&quot;//

&quot;Vaclav is in the majority,&quot; says Buddy, &quot;with my old tribe. We both have connections with him.&quot;

&quot;But he doesn&#39;t really have anything to him besides that,&quot; says Khall. &quot;He&#39;s always concerned about strategy, and that kind of person scares me. He&#39;s a physical threat, too...&quot;

&quot;He&#39;d never see it coming,&quot; says Paula.

&quot;Are you seriously considering this?&quot; Buddy protests.

&quot;The three of us and Jennifer. That&#39;s four. If we have the other five voting Rocky, then no harm no foul,&quot; Paula explains. &quot;We have to be able to consider everything.&quot;

//&quot;Paula, what are you doing?&quot; Buddy looks exasperated and confused. &quot;Now is not the time to be talking about blindsiding your friends. I know she&#39;s not prepared to handle the fallout by herself, and I don&#39;t like how Khall treats us as being so close despite not having any reason to.&quot;//

Later, Buddy walks over to where Jennifer is talking to Candace and Vaclav.

&quot;So, you&#39;re good with a Rocky vote too?&quot; Jennifer says. &quot;That makes it easier for me. I was hoping I would get the chance to do that soon, anyways.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t think it would isolate your old tribe?&quot; Vaclav asks.

&quot;I&#39;ll tell Paula,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;The others I couldn&#39;t care less about.&quot;

&quot;Guys... I think we should split the vote,&quot; says Buddy.

&quot;What? Why?&quot; Candace asks.

&quot;If we get Paula on our side, that&#39;s seven votes against Rocky,&quot; Buddy explains. &quot;But I don&#39;t really trust Louie. He won&#39;t go with a plan that puts Denine next on the block.&quot;

&quot;Rocky&#39;s the only target we can get everyone to agree on,&quot; says Jennifer.

&quot;There&#39;s someone else you wouldn&#39;t have any hard feelings over voting out,&quot; says Buddy, &quot;and that person is Khall.&quot;

&quot;You know what? Screw it,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;If I have you guys&#39; word that you&#39;re taking Rocky out, I&#39;ll vote Khall.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m voting him too,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;We just need two more.&quot;

//&quot;This split vote is a bit too convenient,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;I need another side of the story, just to make sure this isn&#39;t some kind of trap to make me throw my vote away.&quot;//

Vaclav decides to go talk to Louie, only to find him talking to Denine and Rocky.

&quot;Oh, so Buddy was right,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;You&#39;re working with them now.&quot;

&quot;Um, of course,&quot; says Denine.

&quot;I couldn&#39;t believe a single word that came out of their mouths,&quot; says Louie, without an ounce of emotion. &quot;There&#39;s no way they&#39;re going to bring me over each other any farther than they have to.&quot;

&quot;Well, the plan is to split it between Rocky and Khall,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;Do you think we can rope him in and take out a threat?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re joking, right?&quot; Rocky scoffs. &quot;They want to split it between me and Khall, who&#39;s not even someone I&#39;m working with. If we save Khall then we&#39;ve stabbed Jessie in the back for no reason.&quot;

&quot;You mean Jackie,&quot; says Denine.

&quot;Yeah, yeah, whatever.&quot; Rocky crosses his arms. &quot;Point is. Let those guys split it evenly, we pile votes on Khall.&quot;

//&quot;So much for their little majority alliance,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;If they only kept us guessing who would be getting votes, they might actually have been able to make us all look like chumps. But now they&#39;ve played themselves. At this rate I won&#39;t even need to play my idol!&quot;//

Khall is making his case to Ashleia and Rhett.

&quot;Vaclav thinks it&#39;s going to be Rocky tonight,&quot; says Khall, &quot;but if Rocky has an idol we shouldn&#39;t waste it on Denine. Vaclav is the real threat, and if you vote him out then Rocky is next, and you have the five to four majority again.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s right,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;Could we maybe delay Rocky&#39;s vote by a single round?&quot;

Rhett narrows his eyes. &quot;He has to go. As soon as possible.&quot;

&quot;Vaclav is more likely to win immunity than Rocky,&quot; says Khall. &quot;Please. Do you even have a connection with him at all? At least Rocky is a perennial rival of sorts. Vaclav is all strategy now, and that kind of person you can&#39;t have a bond with.&quot;

&quot;Well... I guess,&quot; says Ashleia.

&quot;He got Jarrett out. Who says he doesn&#39;t hold that against you?&quot;

//&quot;I know strategy is not really my thing,&quot; says Khall, &quot;I just want to relax and have fun before I go back to where I came from. But with Vaclav I have hit a wall; I&#39;m sure he hasn&#39;t even watched the latrine for spacetime anomalies like I asked him to.&quot;//

After Khall had left, Ashleia has a word privately with Rhett.

&quot;I think... tonight, it&#39;s not looking like Rocky,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;Vaclav told me he&#39;d rather vote Khall out. If we vote Rocky, we&#39;ll get left behind.&quot;

Rhett shakes his head. &quot;Unbelievable. This is the fifth time now.&quot;

&quot;We just don&#39;t have the means to change it, the two of us,&quot; Ashleia explains. &quot;We need to choose between Khall and Vaclav.&quot;

//&quot;Tonight is going to be, like, difficult for me,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;I&#39;m making my own decisions here, so I need to look at which way will help me. Between Vaclav&#39;s vote, and Khall&#39;s word, I need to decide what I can trust.&quot;//

$v[**Tribal Council**]

The newly formed tribe of Ochalibas walks into the tribal council building, places their lit torches at the back of the room, and sits down.

$v[&quot;Welcome back. Candace, what is your new tribe named?&quot;]

&quot;We called it Ochalibas,&quot; says Candace. &quot;It&#39;s all our old tribes put together, because all that separated us before was a name. So now our tribe name has a part of each of us in it.&quot;

$v[&quot;It&#39;s a double-edged sword, though, is it not?&quot;] Vincent asks. $v[&quot;You could rally under your old tribe name before, but now you&#39;re out for yourselves. Does that make having immunity especially important for you?&quot;]

Candace nods. &quot;Just a few days ago I was at a low point, where I needed my tribe to pull through for me. I couldn&#39;t let that happen again.&quot;

$v[&quot;In previous tribal councils, you all had one outside player you could deal with however you wanted. Some of you have been in that position, others have not. Denine, do you think having that role and seeing more than just your tribemates strategize will help you out?&quot;]

&quot;No, that doesn&#39;t matter anymore,&quot; says Denine. &quot;Because we&#39;ve already met most of the others, we hear things. So we already have an opinion on most people here.&quot;

&quot;Speak for yourself,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;I haven&#39;t gone to tribal with some of these people. I need to see for myself whether they&#39;re as trustworthy or reliable or dangerous as the others want me to believe.&quot;

$v[&quot;Jennifer, you were never kidnapped by the winning team. Do you think what Buddy says is accurate?&quot;]

&quot;Yeah, there are a few people I&#39;ve never seen vulnerable,&quot; Jennifer explains. &quot;But the vast majority of people have worked with me, or against me, so I have an inkling of how to deal with them. Tonight will clear up the remaining doubts.&quot;

$v[&quot;Rocky, I see you rolling your eyes. What&#39;s your take on this?&quot;]

&quot;Jennifer&#39;s out of her mind, as usual,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;Clearly if she knew how to deal with me, Monty would still be here. And treating me like an obstacle and not a fellow player just makes me want to prove her wrong again, and again, and again.&quot;

&quot;You won&#39;t get the chance,&quot; Rhett blurts out. &quot;Your days in this game are numbered, Rocky.&quot;

&quot;You and what army?&quot; Rocky replies.

&quot;I&#39;m not giving away my secrets just because I don&#39;t know yours yet,&quot; says Rhett.

$v[&quot;Paula, does this mean Rocky&#39;s name is back on the table tonight?&quot;]

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve heard it,&quot; says Paula. &quot;I don&#39;t know whether people actually want to write his name down, or if people are just saying it because everyone else is.&quot;

$v[&quot;Vaclav, why would someone not write Rocky&#39;s name down?&quot;]

&quot;Hey!&quot; Rocky shouts. &quot;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&quot;

&quot;Maybe people are saying Rocky because it is the safest name to put out,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;But it is not the smartest, and I think most people here know that. They are trying to buy time until they can come up with a better move. You have to be thinking all the time, and be ready for anything, or you will be left out.&quot;

&quot;I think you take it too far, though,&quot; says Louie. &quot;Sometimes a pipe is just a pipe, the saying goes.&quot;

$v[&quot;Khall, do you think there&#39;s something that people are keeping hush about tonight?&quot;]

&quot;Yeah, and I don&#39;t know why,&quot; says Khall. &quot;Everyone should know that there&#39;s a better plan tonight. From a narrative perspective, the timing is right for the merge vote to be a turning point, a big blindside.&quot;

&quot;What are you getting at...?&quot; Vaclav asks.

&quot;Rarely do you see the merge go as smoothly as everyone deciding to vote against Rocky,&quot; says Khall. &quot;We get the line drawn in the sand at this point between the people who flip... and the people who lose.&quot;

&quot;That didn&#39;t sound like something you&#39;d normally say,&quot; Paula whispers.

&quot;Extraordinary circumstances,&quot; Khall whispers back. &quot;After this I&#39;d rather go back to being the comic relief for the season&#39;s focal point duo.&quot;

$v[&quot;Okay, it is time to vote,&quot;] says Vincent. $v[&quot;Buddy, you are up first.&quot;]

...

Khall casts his vote for **Vaclav**. &quot;Silly and serious don&#39;t mix. Nothing personal.&quot;

Vaclav casts his vote for **Khall**. &quot;I do not understand you. I never did. You are not understandable.&quot;

...

$votesarein
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Wait, not yet!&quot; Vaclav calls out. He gets up from his seat and pulls a bracelet out from underneath his sleeve. He hands it to Vincent. &quot;I&#39;m playing the idol on me.&quot;

Vincent takes the bracelet from him. $v[&quot;Vaclav is playing a hidden immunity idol... all votes cast for him will not count.&quot;]

&quot;What a waste,&quot; Jennifer mutters under her breath.

Denine looks on, completely confused.

$v[&quot;First vote... Vaclav. Does not count.&quot;]

&quot;I knew it,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;You were hiding something from me! You cannot make a fool out of me.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$v[&quot;Second vote... Khall.&quot;]

&quot;Thanks, Vaclav,&quot; says Khall.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$v[&quot;Khall. He leads with two.&quot;]
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$v[&quot;Khall. three votes for Khall.&quot;]

Jennifer and Buddy exchange a knowing glance.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$v[&quot;Khall.&quot;]

&quot;Well, this sucks,&quot; says Khall.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$v[&quot;Khall. Five votes for Khall.&quot;]

&quot;Wait... is this unanimous?&quot; Rhett asks. &quot;How did Rocky know?&quot;

Rocky rolls his eyes.

$v[&quot;Eighth $boot is **Khall**. You need to bring me your torch.&quot;]

&quot;Yeeeeeah, who possibly could have told him who else was on the chopping block?&quot; Louie says, with a smirk.

&quot;Son of a bitch, Louie,&quot; Rhett growls. &quot;You betrayed us!&quot;

&quot;I had no loyalty to you, Rhett,&quot; says Louie.

Khall shakes his head. &quot;This is the kind of double dealing and negativity I wanted to avoid.&quot; He had already brought his torch to Vincent.

$v[&quot;Khall, the tribe has spoken.&quot;] Vincent snuffs the purple-clad ninja&#39;s torch. $v[&quot;Time for you to go.&quot;]

&quot;Understood.&quot; Khall walks out of the tribal council building, looking forlorn.

$v[&quot;After three weeks of saying it was Rocky&#39;s time to go, your bluffs were finally called tonight,&quot;] says Vincent. $v[&quot;It&#39;s clear all of you wanted to bring an end to the status quo. Let&#39;s see if that was a mistake. You can head back to camp.&quot;]

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$m[&quot;Why do they even call it a council anyways? I don&#39;t recall ever being elected a councillor for anything,&quot; says Khall. &quot;Oh, you wanted me to talk about being voted out? I didn&#39;t see it coming. I thought I had set myself up for being the likable mid-juror. I&#39;m a little relieved, though, because if people here think more like Vaclav than me, then it&#39;s not going to get any more fun from here on out.&quot;]

Voting Results:
**Khall - Ashleia, Buddy, Candace, Denine, Jennifer, Louie, Paula, Rhett, Rocky, Vaclav**
~~Vaclav~~ - Khall (void)

&quot;And we all walked away from that vote satisfied,&quot; says Denine.

&quot;And watch it never happen again,&quot; Buddy replies.

Denine smirks. &quot;You&#39;re right.&quot;

//&quot;I love when things go according to plan,&quot; Denine explains. &quot;Khall left, and most people are okay with it. I was worried that it was going to be the same old story, but maybe people are finally realizing there are more things you can do than target anyone who speaks to me.&quot;//

Louie nudges Vaclav in the side, and the two of them step away for a private conversation.

&quot;What&#39;s the deal?&quot; Vaclav asks. &quot;Are you still thinking about what Rhett said?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t care about what Rhett thinks,&quot; Louie replies. &quot;I&#39;m more upset with you.&quot;

&quot;Because I pleaded my case?&quot; The glasses-sporting man crosses his arms.

&quot;Because you played an idol for no reason.&quot;

&quot;I had a great reason to play it,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;Nobody told me why Khall was targeted instead of Rocky. I would have been fine with either, but everyone was being suspicious.&quot;

&quot;Suspicious... how?&quot; Louie asks.

//&quot;I kind of thought of Vaclav was my secret weapon,&quot; Louie explains. &quot;He&#39;s emotionally dependent on me, but nobody else really knows. The more of a buffer I have, the better. The fact that he had an advantage he kept to himself, and then absolutely wasted it this early, definitely makes me question how much I can trust him.&quot;//

&quot;Everyone told me it was going to be Rocky,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;Then suddenly, everyone says it was going to be Khall. I asked why, they all said don&#39;t worry about it. Khall does not talk to me. Nobody does. Why would I think I am not about to be betrayed?&quot;

&quot;Why would you think anyone would keep Khall over you?&quot; says Louie. &quot;Everyone said he was impossible to work with.&quot;

&quot;Everyone was impossible to work with today!&quot; Vaclav counters. &quot;I cannot work with people who do not give me information.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll give you information,&quot; says Louie. &quot;That&#39;s the one thing you can take away from this. If nobody else does, I still owe you for saving me.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;I owe you as well.&quot;

//&quot;I&#39;m using the last vote where we both got targeted as reassurance,&quot; Louie explains. &quot;If I can&#39;t keep him under my control, then I want him to at least have faith in me that I&#39;ll pay him back for saving my game.&quot;//

//&quot;Louie thinks he is the one in charge between us,&quot; says Vaclav. His hands are folded together, but they are clenched and slightly trembling. &quot;I do not follow anyone, and I will do what it takes to show I am my own master. He will get my support if it works for me, but no time else.&quot;//

Paula, meanwhile, has a quick conversation with Candace.

&quot;I felt sick doing that,&quot; says Paula. &quot;Khall trusted me, but I hated the situation he put me in.&quot;

Candace nods. &quot;I appreciate you not going rogue, though. It just gives me a little more faith that our group can tough things out.&quot;

&quot;So, the plan&#39;s still the same for next time?&quot; Paula asks.

&quot;Most likely,&quot; says Candace. &quot;Rocky&#39;s the number one target. We could maybe switch it for Denine or Louie, though.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m trying to decide if it makes sense to keep Denine and Louie together, is all,&quot; Paula explains.

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve heard those two are tight,&quot; says Candace. &quot;Voting one out would make the other vengeful, but they can be more easily separated from Rocky than they can be from each other.&quot;

&quot;Denine admitted that she doesn&#39;t like him,&quot; says Paula.

//&quot;For all his faults, Rocky is cunning,&quot; says Candace. &quot;I don&#39;t want to have to deal with him, but that doesn&#39;t mean we have to vote him out. We may be able to neutralize him by voting out one of his reluctant allies.&quot;//

&quot;But who between Denine and Louie is the better target?&quot; Paula asks. &quot;I don&#39;t know much at all about Louie.&quot;

&quot;I think probably Denine, she&#39;s the more vocal one,&quot; says Candace. &quot;Plus, Louie and Rocky might turn on each other once she&#39;s gone.&quot;

&quot;Rocky was more ready to flip than Denine was,&quot; Paula adds. &quot;I can buy that he&#39;s even more disloyal than she is.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m beginning to like this plan,&quot; says Candace. &quot;I do sense a shift in Rocky&#39;s aura, so there may be a secret he&#39;s hiding from us. Do you think we can make him believe his back is against the wall and that any advantage is all he has?&quot;

Paula shakes her head. &quot;I&#39;m at a loss. I need to think about it.&quot;

//&quot;I thought we had agreed the question of the day was not who to vote out, but how,&quot; says Paula. &quot;Candace&#39;s idea of voting out Denine is tempting, but what would have to change from what I had planned? There are quite a few minds to be made up, too, and I don&#39;t feel comfortable without a consensus.&quot;//

$m[**Day 23**]

It&#39;s early in the morning, and Jennifer is awake and exploring the camp alone.

//&quot;I figured I should get the jump on the others and look for anything that&#39;s been hidden here,&quot; she explains. &quot;Now&#39;s about the right time for a merge advantage to start appearing, so I would love to get my hands on it and put myself in a position of power because of it. I&#39;m taking this game back!&quot;//

As Jennifer is searching among the rocks and the undergrowth near camp, she mumbles to herself, trying to talk herself through the process of searching. She lifts leaves and lowers herself to the ground to see if anything pops out in the dirt. 

&quot;It&#39;s not going to be just anywhere,&quot; she says to herself. She pulls her buff up to her forehead to keep sweat out of her eyes.

Jennifer also looks among branches, and in tree trunks, but has no luck there either.

Eventually, Jennifer decides to head back to camp to avoid suspicion when everyone else is just getting up. On the way back to the shelter, she notices a slight bulge in the fabric of the Ochalibas flag. She walks over, reaches her hand in between the sheets of fabric, and feels around until she grabs on to a folded piece of paper. She gently wriggles it out and stuffs it in her pocket.

//&quot;I found something!&quot; Jennifer excitedly says to the camera, before opening up the piece of paper she found. She then reads it aloud. &quot;Congratulations, you have found a hidden advantage. This allows you to steal a vote from another player at tribal council.&quot; She immediately grips the note tightly with a single hand. &quot;Oh my god, oh my god, this is fantastic. I feel good about where I am right now, but who knows what the future holds? I&#39;d rather be ready to make a quick turnaround than go down with an unwanted plan.&quot;//

Jennifer rejoins the rest of the tribe to have a small portion of rice for breakfast.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe he&#39;s still here,&quot; Rhett mutters to her.

&quot;Khall had sided with Rocky before,&quot; Jennifer whispers. &quot;It&#39;s almost the same.&quot;

&quot;I know... but just look at him,&quot; Rhett whispers back.

Rocky stares Rhett right in the eyes, and snarls.

//&quot;Rhett is a waste of oxygen,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;He does nothing but whine about how jealous he is of me or something. Well... I know it&#39;s not jealousy. But I&#39;m sure his real reason makes even less sense. I flat out don&#39;t care for anything he has to say.&quot;//

&quot;The way that a young, athletic person like Rocky is so meticulous with the way he eats his rice...&quot; Rhett mumbles. &quot;It&#39;s our most reliable source of nutrition out here, and he treats it with such ill regard. I just don&#39;t get it...&quot;

&quot;He won&#39;t be so careful with his food in the jury house,&quot; Jennifer mutters.

&quot;That&#39;s the thing. It might not be that simple,&quot; Rhett explains. &quot;He did poorly in the last challenge, but the Survivor challenges often rely on a lot of different abilities. They must have gotten the least Rocky-friendly challenge out of the way while he still could easily escape the vote. The smaller this group gets, the more easily Rocky will be able to win his way to the end. And immunity beasts are exactly what the network wants. We won&#39;t be able to stop him.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s nothing we can do but wait,&quot; says Jennifer.

&quot;Hey, Jennifer,&quot; Rocky calls out. &quot;You got something you want to share with the class?&quot;

&quot;If we can&#39;t have a private conversation without you sticking your smelly mug into it,&quot; says Jennifer, &quot;then we&#39;ll have it right in front of you. What are you going to do about it?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s no way to win friends,&quot; says Rocky.

&quot;I don&#39;t need friends, I need immunity and a cheeseburger,&quot; Jennifer snaps.

Louie nudges Denine. &quot;I think we should test that theory. Tell Vaclav that we want Rhett out next.&quot;

&quot;Why do I have to do it?&quot; Denine asks.

&quot;We need him to trust you,&quot; Louie replies quietly.

//&quot;If Denine and Vaclav are seen together, then I can better hide the fact that I&#39;m the one holding them together,&quot; says Louie. &quot;Both of them are still connected to me, and Rocky is the distraction for all three of us. I&#39;m keeping my head down so nobody can see me try to pull the strings.&quot;//

Jennifer puts one hand on Rhett&#39;s shoulder and whispers in his ear. &quot;Stay calm, don&#39;t move a muscle. I found an advantage this morning.&quot;

Rhett bites his lip, struggling to hide his relief. He then turns back to whisper something to Jennifer.

&quot;Good. We can&#39;t let it fall into the hands of Rocky or one of his goons.&quot;

Jennifer nods very minutely so only Rhett can see.

//&quot;Louie is clearly in on whatever Rocky&#39;s scheme is, that much is clear to me,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;He admitted it last night. I know Denine has a strong intellect, but I fear she will use it for selfish gain as well. The merge has given that forsaken trio more confidence and power, and it is only a matter of time until Vincent steps in to stack the deck in their favour.&quot;//

The thinner of Rocky&#39;s goons taps Vaclav on the shoulder, and the two get up and leave together to talk in private.

&quot;Louie wanted me to tell you who he wanted out next,&quot; Denine explains. &quot;Jennifer and Rhett are, clearly, the ones who dislike Rocky most. You saw how Jennifer talked to him two votes ago. So, he wants to split those two up to keep his meat shield intact.&quot;

&quot;Which one does he want out?&quot; Vaclav asks.

&quot;He said Rhett,&quot; says Denine.

Vaclav nods. &quot;So, you say he wants to kill the alliance.&quot;

&quot;Clearly.&quot;

//&quot;Rhett thinks this game is a one man show, the Rocky Show. That is not true,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;And if I need to work with Rocky, and Rhett is in the game, I look like the bad guy. I do not want to look like the bad guy!&quot;//

 &quot;It would be easier to just go with the plan and vote Rocky,&quot; Vaclav says. &quot;Then we will not have to hear about him anymore.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a last resort,&quot; Denine says quickly. &quot;If we have a choice, one of Rhett or Jennifer needs to go. Our respect is at stake. If they manage to poison the others&#39; minds, then we&#39;ll be branded goats no matter what we do.&quot;

&quot;So, you would rather be able to use Rocky,&quot; says Vaclav.

&quot;He might as well be of some worth to us, right?&quot; Denine shrugs.

//&quot;I remember way back, more than a week ago, when Jennifer and Rhett told us we would work together and then they brilliantly shut me and Louie out of their clique,&quot; says Denine. &quot;Well, payback&#39;s a bitch. I have nothing to lose by taking those two down. I&#39;d love to take them out and flush Rocky&#39;s stupid idol at the same time, but they can happen at different speeds, I&#39;m not in a hurry.&quot;//

Later in the day, Buddy pulls Rocky aside to have a short conversation.

&quot;Look, Rocky,&quot; says Buddy, &quot;I know we don&#39;t really have the best history.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s your point?&quot; Rocky asks, genuinely curious.

&quot;After last night, it&#39;s clear to me that just throwing your name out isn&#39;t going to do anyone good,&quot; Buddy explains. &quot;I have other people in mind that I&#39;d rather focus my efforts on.&quot;

&quot;You aren&#39;t begging for my help, are you?&quot; Rocky replies. &quot;Because I have a plan beyond just scrambling, and I intend to stick to it.&quot;

&quot;I doubt it,&quot; says Buddy, &quot;and I don&#39;t really need your help either. Here&#39;s the thing, though. I know Jennifer hates your guts, and Rhett hates your guts, whatever. Those two I have connections with. I can keep them off your back if you keep your allies off mine.&quot;

&quot;See, now things are starting to get interesting,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;You all are starting to realize I&#39;m not playing around. Well, rest assured, Buddy-boy, I&#39;m not even thinking of voting you out.&quot;

&quot;You helped swing the vote to save me way back when I was first vulnerable,&quot; Buddy explains. &quot;Consider this paying you back. And let me know if you need a number.&quot;

//&quot;I want Rocky to know my allies don&#39;t speak for me,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;So, I&#39;m extending an olive branch of sorts. I&#39;ll try to take the heat off him if he lets me pick off his allies. If that doesn&#39;t happen, then we take him out and I tell him there&#39;s nothing I could have done.&quot;//

Reward Challenge**

The ten contestants are standing on the tribe mat, which was now twenty meters away from a staircase leading up a hill.

$v[&quot;Your next challenge will be a team challenge,&quot;] Vincent explains. $v[&quot;You will compete in two groups of five. One at a time, you will send a member up these steps into an abandoned hilltop village. You will have to find a puzzle piece in either] $q[indigo] $v[or] $c[pink]$v[, and bring it down the steps. Once all five of you have brought down your puzzle pieces, you will race to assemble them into the shape of a cube. There is only one correct solution. First group to assemble a cube wins reward. Want to know what you&#39;re playing for? ... An afternoon on a jungle cruise, in this little pocket of the Amazon rainforest. On a speedboat! We&#39;ll draw for spots, and let&#39;s get started.&quot;]

$c[Pink team:] Buddy, Denine, Jennifer, Louie, Rhett

$q[Indigo team:] Ashleia, Candace, Paula, Rocky, Vaclav

Louie and Paula are the first to go for their puzzle pieces.

Paula comes down long before Louie does. Next for the indigo team is Candace.

Louie comes down with a piece, and the next to go is Denine.

Candace brings down a puzzle piece, and Rocky goes next.

Denine comes back down with a piece, visibly pale. &quot;That was really freaky,&quot; she mumbles.

&quot;Nobody cares, let&#39;s go!&quot; Rhett sprints up the staircase.

Rocky and Rhett come down with pieces at around the same time. The next to go are Vaclav and Jennifer, with Jennifer putting more distance between them with each step.

Jennifer later comes down with her piece, and tags Buddy in.

Vaclav brings down a puzzle piece, and Ashleia is the last to go up the steps.

&quot;This feels really wrong,&quot; says Vaclav to his group. &quot;I do not think we should be up there.&quot;

&quot;I did sense a lingering spirit of suffering and illness,&quot; says Candace.

Rocky scoffs. &quot;Don&#39;t get your panties in a twist, we&#39;ll be fine.&quot;

The next one to come down with their team&#39;s final puzzle piece is Buddy.

&quot;Okay, I definitely saw some human remains in one of those huts,&quot; he says, gripping his puzzle piece tightly in his arms.

Louie yanks it out of Buddy&#39;s grip and throws it with the rest of them. &quot;No time to talk, we gotta hustle on the puzzle.&quot; The pink tribe gets to work.

A few minutes later, Ashleia comes down with the indigo team&#39;s last piece. &quot;Like, you are not going to believe what I found up there.&quot; She drops her puzzle piece and holds up an ornate golden bracelet, studded with gemstones and amber. &quot;Isn&#39;t this the most glamourous thing ever, Paula?&quot;

Candace&#39;s eyes go wide. &quot;Where did you get that!?&quot;

&quot;When I was looking for the puzzle piece,&quot; says Ashleia.

&quot;You don&#39;t know what&#39;s on that thing,&quot; Candace tells her. &quot;Could be soot, or blood... a centuries-old curse...&quot;

$v[&quot;Louie, Denine, Buddy, Rhett, and Jennifer win reward!&quot;]

&quot;Gee, thanks, guys!&quot; Rocky crosses his arms. &quot;We could have won that if you weren&#39;t girling out over some stupid gold bracelet!&quot;

&quot;Rocky, just be quiet for once!&quot; Vaclav snaps.

**Reward – Speedboat Ride**

As the boat begins to drive off, the five challenge winners look around and admire the view.

&quot;It&#39;s definitely a lot nicer looking from this boat,&quot; says Buddy.

&quot;I agree,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;The boat gives the psychological bubble of protection we don&#39;t have back at camp.&quot;

&quot;Until we hit a rock,&quot; says Louie.

Rhett looks at Louie and frowns. &quot;Do you ever... enjoy... anything?&quot;

//&quot;I appreciate this reward,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;A change of environment is always welcomed, especially one away from you know who. But there was another benefit to this trip as well.&quot;//

&quot;Whoa, lit!&quot; Denine exclaims as she opens up a cooler sitting at their feet. &quot;We got beer!&quot;

&quot;Now this I can get behind,&quot; says Jennifer, as she and Denine each grab a bottle.

&quot;Eh, why not.&quot; Buddy takes a bottle as well. While he and Jennifer start with a sip, Denine drinks a third of the bottle in a single gulp.

&quot;Not going to join the party?&quot; Louie asks Rhett.

Rhett shakes his head. &quot;Not out here. I cannot be certain that this is not a trap of some kind.&quot;

&quot;And just after you were calling me a killjoy,&quot; says Louie.

&quot;Maybe you have a point,&quot; Rhett replies, &quot;this time.&quot;

//&quot;You know what kind of reward I would really enjoy?&quot; Louie asks rhetorically. &quot;A chance to brush my teeth. I&#39;m not in the mood to drink, I have enough of a paunch as is, and there&#39;s nothing I&#39;m actively trying to forget.&quot;//

It did not take long before Louie and Rhett had shuffled to one end of the boat, while Buddy, Denine, and Jennifer shuffled to the end with the beer cooler.

&quot;Is that, like, your third bottle?&quot; Buddy asks Denine.

Denine shakes her head. &quot;Nah, number two. I&#39;ll leave one in case either of those two changes their mind and wants to loosen up.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re going to be so trashed tomorrow,&quot; says Buddy.

&quot;Nah, it&#39;s worth it!&quot; Denine exclaims. &quot;You think I&#39;m going to win immunity anyways? I just want to kick back right now.&quot;

&quot;And not have to worry about Rocky,&quot; Jennifer adds.

&quot;Truuuuue! Cheers to that!&quot; Denine clinks bottles with Jennifer.

//&quot;I wanted to see if Denine would loosen up enough to talk to me,&quot; Jennifer explains. &quot;Maybe alcohol is her weakness, and I can use that to flip her.&quot;//

&quot;Why don&#39;t we just get rid of him?&quot; Jennifer asks. &quot;Like, we can totally do it. The five of us on this boat can take control of the game. We dominate the others in challenges.&quot;

&quot;Bitch, why you wanna talk about that right now?&quot; Denine snaps.

&quot;Because he&#39;s not here,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;You&#39;re not doing yourself any favours by hanging on to him and acting like he won&#39;t screw you over.&quot;

&quot;Jennifer,&quot; says Buddy, &quot;I think she really doesn&#39;t want to talk about it.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, listen to Buddy!&quot; says Denine. &quot;I don&#39;t have this in my hand because I&#39;m out here trying to strategize.&quot;

Jennifer looks displeased. &quot;You can&#39;t do this and then claim we&#39;re treating you unfairly.&quot;

&quot;Well, you&#39;re not my mom,&quot; says Denine.

//&quot;Should I turn on Rocky? Maybe I will, maybe I won&#39;t,&quot; Denine explains. Her hair is more unkempt than usual. &quot;But Jen. Really. She was going back to her old bossy self, the way that made me jump ship before, and if she can&#39;t see that&#39;s why I was trying to drown her out, that&#39;s her own damn fault.&quot;//

&quot;She has a point,&quot; says Rhett to Louie. &quot;You should rethink your stance on-&quot;

&quot;Rhett, I will throw you overboard and feed you to the gators.&quot;

Rhett blinks. &quot;A simple &#39;no&#39; would suffice.&quot;

&quot;Knowing you,&quot; says Louie, &quot;it probably would not.&quot;

$m[**Ochalibas**]

Ashleia, Candace, Paula, Rocky, and Vaclav sit near the fire after returning from the challenge.

&quot;Talk about déjà vu,&quot; says Paula. &quot;Splitting that group up was kind of why I liked having the swap so much.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s incredible how much teamwork they can have despite all their fighting,&quot; says Ashleia in agreement.

&quot;It blows major chunks,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;But they can&#39;t work together for immunity.&quot;

&quot;Well, then what&#39;s the issue?&quot; Candace asks.

&quot;They keep going on rewards, come back feeling great, then they kick our asses,&quot; Rocky explains. &quot;Those five may hate each other, but they&#39;re not saying one of them needs to go.&quot;

Ashleia raises her index finger to get the others&#39; attention. &quot;I get it! So, like, they said to vote you, and then changed their minds to Khall. But they never said to vote one of their own out.&quot;

&quot;And it was your idea to vote Louie out when we swapped,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;Buddy was happy to vote me out before you brought that up.&quot;

&quot;And Jennifer insisted that Rocky was the real target and not Denine,&quot; adds Paula.

&quot;Oh my god,&quot; says Candace. &quot;They&#39;ve //all// been playing us.&quot;

//&quot;I don&#39;t know if the Chalpe conspiracy is true,&quot; says Rocky, &quot;but it&#39;s really convenient to get people off my back! I&#39;m going to keep milking this all I can so I can get rid of the two old Chalpe members that just won&#39;t stop obsessing over me. Time to get to work on putting that plan into action.&quot;//

Candace, Ashleia, and Vaclav agree to meet up by themselves later in the day.

&quot;So, what do you think about what Rocky said?&quot; Vaclav asks. &quot;Does it make sense to you?&quot;

&quot;The frustrating thing is the messenger,&quot; says Candace. &quot;His essence of malice is still present.&quot;

&quot;But, like, do you want to be known as &#39;the pure-hearted early juror&#39;?&quot; Ashleia asks. &quot;Like, we have to consider it. We don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about on the boat.&quot;

&quot;Which is why I say we should go with him.&quot; Candace takes a deep breath. &quot;Maybe I am merely registering a false positive, after all. But we can&#39;t let them know.&quot;

&quot;So we, like, just don&#39;t vote him but don&#39;t tell the others?&quot; asks Ashleia again.

&quot;Or just convince our own alliances that it&#39;s the wrong move,&quot; Candace replies. &quot;Rocky has his pals, we have our own. If we can steer it towards being between two of them, then they have no choice but to either break themselves up or prove Rocky&#39;s theory right.&quot;

&quot;Well I&#39;m not going to say this was Rocky&#39;s idea,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;He kind of needs us for this to work.&quot;

//&quot;I&#39;m, like, really glad I have Candace&#39;s trust now.&quot; Ashleia fiddles with her new bracelet. &quot;We have a plan coming together, so I&#39;m not as worried about being ignored or disrespected.&quot;//

&quot;Now the issue is, you might want to vote out one person,&quot; says Vaclav, &quot;but Rocky will have another idea.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s right, we have to make sure we&#39;re the ones who get our target out,&quot; says Candace.

&quot;It would maybe be Louie, again,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;Since he&#39;s working with Rocky.&quot;

&quot;So is Denine,&quot; Vaclav adds. &quot;If we vote one of them out, then Rocky will flip to take the other out.&quot;

//&quot;Rocky&#39;s case makes sense,&quot; says Candace, &quot;but what if we&#39;re all wrong? Then it&#39;s back to what it was before, so the only way to be safe is to vote against someone who&#39;s not part of either of our plans. And right now, that&#39;s Denine and Louie. There&#39;s not any doubt in my mind anymore that one of them needs to go.&quot;//

Meanwhile, Rocky is chatting with Paula.

&quot;Now, you know I wouldn&#39;t drop a bombshell like that without a plan, right?&quot; Rocky smirks.

Paula shuffles in place, but says nothing.

&quot;Alright, so here&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;You and Vaclav flip and vote Rhett out.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know if I should drop everything to work with the person who tried to get me out two rounds ago,&quot; Paula replies.

&quot;In my mind, either he or Jennifer has to go, immediately,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;Now, Jennifer is your friend, and I&#39;m sure she&#39;d be grateful if you convinced me not to get her out.&quot;

&quot;Are you blackmailing me?&quot; Paula asks softly.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t call it that,&quot; says Rocky, &quot;it&#39;s more like-&quot;

&quot;Because you don&#39;t need to do that.&quot;

//&quot;I don&#39;t let big personalities scare me or boss me around,&quot; says Paula. &quot;I may not be the angriest or the loudest, but I trust myself enough to know what&#39;s right. If I make a decision, it&#39;s usually because I&#39;ve weighed all my options and how they&#39;ll help myself and others.&quot;//

 &quot;I won&#39;t let you intimidate me into playing your game,&quot; Paula tells Rocky. &quot;But that does not mean I refuse to speak with you. Why else should I vote Rhett out?&quot;

Rocky is taken aback, but he takes a deep breath and continues. &quot;If we want to break up Chalpe and make sure they aren&#39;t in a secret pact, one of them has to go right now. You like Jennifer, and she might get pissed if you vote Buddy out. Denine can&#39;t do jack to you so she&#39;s no threat while I&#39;m here, and Louie is kind of a joke.&quot;

&quot;So that leaves Rhett as the only option,&quot; says Paula.

&quot;Exactly,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;If I&#39;m gone, do you know what Rhett is going to do? Of course not. I&#39;m all he talks about. He&#39;s a bright guy... apparently. Do you really want to be unprepared for whatever he&#39;s hiding?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s one problem,&quot; says Paula. &quot;You don&#39;t have the numbers. You&#39;ll need to prove that you&#39;re not getting me to just throw my vote away, then we&#39;ll talk.&quot;

&quot;Y&#39;know, you drive a hard bargain.&quot; Rocky smiles. &quot;I like that.&quot;

&quot;Neat.&quot; Paula replies flatly.

//&quot;I think I have the fifth vote I need, now,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;Assuming that my new allies are actually any good and can get Vaclav to vote with us. Now all I need is for nobody to be willing to save that trainwreck in a tie.&quot;//

Later in the evening, when the rest of the tribe returns from reward, only Vaclav is at camp waiting for them.

&quot;Hey, Vaclav, how was being a loser?&quot; Denine asks. She has one arm draped behind Louie&#39;s neck, her hand resting just below his shoulder.

&quot;Your breath stinks of alcohol,&quot; says Vaclav.

&quot;Some of us partook,&quot; says Jennifer. She shrugs. &quot;Those of us that had to be on a tribe with Rocky needed to relax.&quot;

&quot;She is so hard done by,&quot; Louie whispers to Buddy.

&quot;Then you should be calling it a night soon,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;We have a challenge tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Why, so you can sneak off and find another idol?&quot; Rhett asks.

&quot;Wh-what does that have to do with it?&quot; Vaclav exclaims.

&quot;You admit it, then,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;Probably waiting for the camera crew to plant it somewhere people have already looked.&quot;

&quot;I think you need the sleep most of all,&quot; Vaclav replies.

&quot;Not a chance. I&#39;ll be watching you like a hawk.&quot; Rhett says, coldly looking Vaclav right in the eyes.

//Vaclav scratches his head. &quot;Did I miss something?&quot;//

&lt;span class=&#39;newday&#39;&gt;[[Day 25&lt;-Read Day 25]]&lt;/span&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name="Day 25" tags="" position="1306,309" size="100,100">**Day 25
Immunity Challenge**

The ten members of the merged tribe arrive in the regular challenge area, where Vincent is waiting for them.

$v[&quot;Time for your next immunity challenge. But first, Candace, I&#39;ll need that necklace back.&quot;]

Candace sighs and lets Vincent take the immunity necklace off of her, and Vincent places it on a display.

$v[&quot;Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today&#39;s challenge, each of you will have to pull on a rope to keep an unbalanced tabletop level. At the other end of the rope is a stand with six letter blocks, you must bring them one at a time to your table and stack them, so they spell the word &quot;SAFETY&quot;. If your table tips and any blocks to fall off, you must start over. Once you stack all six blocks, you must move back until your feet are next to the stand. First person to do so wins immunity. Losers, tribal council where one of you will be voted out. We&#39;ll draw for spots, then let&#39;s get started.&quot;]

The scene changes to all ten players at their stations, standing in front of their tabletops and not holding the ropes.

$v[&quot;Alright. For immunity, survivors ready... GO!&quot;]

Everyone grabs onto their ropes and begins moving backwards to get their first block. Without anything to balance, nobody has any difficulty getting the Y block and bringing it to their table.

When moving backwards to get the T block, some contestants start to struggle. Buddy moves too fast and his table tips, Louie trips and lets go of his rope, and when Candace reaches for her second block, she leans too far and pulls the rope too hard.

Rocky and Jennifer quickly emerge as the forerunners in the challenge, as the others are either slower or keep tilting their tabletop and having to re-stack.

Once Rocky and Jennifer had stacked four blocks and were going for their fifth, only Paula and Vaclav had managed to keep three blocks steady. Rocky notices that he is still at the same pace as Jennifer, so he takes a large step back to try and gain a few seconds on her. Once he stabilizes, almost all of the lead he created has disappeared.

Rocky and Jennifer stack their fifth block at roughly the same time, and while Paula approaches with her fourth block, Vaclav&#39;s block stack topples, making him have to put his fourth block back before re-stacking.

Upon taking their sixth and final blocks, Jennifer and Rocky slow down considerably. Rocky is focused on his own tabletop, while Jennifer sometimes glances over at Rocky.

Eventually, Rocky catches Jennifer looking at him. He turns right back to his own challenge station, but says &quot;What&#39;s your major malfunction, Jen? Can&#39;t a guy work in peace?&quot;

&quot;You only seem to care about peace when you&#39;re in danger,&quot; says Jennifer.

&quot;Of course, I&#39;m in danger,&quot; Rocky replies. &quot;I&#39;m so close to winning, but at any point I could just **CHOKE!!**&quot;

Several of the jumpier competitors lose their focus and their block stacks fall.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Including Jennifer&#39;s.

&quot;You piece of shit,&quot; Jennifer mutters.

As Jennifer works to restack her tower, Paula catches up with her, and Rocky inches towards the finish.

In the end, Rocky plants both feet beside his block stand, with Paula in a distant second.

$v[&quot;Rocky wins immunity!&quot;]

&quot;Boo-yah!&quot; Rocky cheers, as he lets go of his rope and his completed tower spelling SAFETY collapses. &quot;I&#39;m untouchable, baby! Suck it!&quot;

Vincent calls Rocky over to him and places the immunity necklace around his neck. $v[&quot;Congratulations, Rocky, you have won immunity and secured yourself a spot in the final nine.&quot;]

Rocky beams with happiness as he adjusts the immunity necklace. Nobody else is particularly happy for him.

$v[&quot;The rest of you will see me at tribal council tonight, where another one of you will be voted out of the game. Head back to camp.&quot;]

$m[**Ochalibas**]

//&quot;This was not supposed to happen,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;Of all the people in this game who are shady and untrustworthy, Rocky continues to be among them! I have been forced to execute the next part of my plan prematurely.&quot;//

Rhett, Jennifer, Paula, and Candace are standing together discussing what to do.

&quot;It looks like our only option is Denine or Louie,&quot; says Candace. &quot;Do you have any preferences between those two?&quot;

&quot;I say Denine,&quot; says Paula. &quot;Louie won&#39;t win immunity. Denine might.&quot;

&quot;I think Louie,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;Louie seems to take glee in working against the common good, while Denine simply appears to be misguided.&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;m honestly down for whatever you all agree on,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;Neither is really any better to me, or to us as a group.&quot;

//&quot;I was one hundred percent set on taking Rocky out, finally,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;But now that he has immunity, I&#39;m stuck sitting here going &#39;uhh I don&#39;t know&#39;. My two backups are both equally untrustworthy!&quot;//

Rocky walks up to the group, chewing on a fruit. &quot;So, what&#39;s up, guys? Seen anything cool recently?&quot;

&quot;Shut up, Rocky,&quot; Jennifer snaps. &quot;We&#39;re trying to figure out who we&#39;re voting tonight, and you know that.&quot;

&quot;Ah, right,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;I forgot. You know, because I&#39;m safe tonight and everything.&quot;

&quot;Rub it in some more, I dare you,&quot; says Jennifer.

Rocky steps towards Jennifer. &quot;You wanted me out, and then you flopped at immunity and now you don&#39;t know what to do!&quot; He smirks. &quot;Not like you would have, anyways. You&#39;d have found a way to backstab someone instead. That&#39;s kind of your thing, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;No, because unlike you,&quot; Jennifer says with a scowl, &quot;I don&#39;t play around with people.&quot;

&quot;You played around with Denine by telling her you wanted to work with her,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;Then you threw her under the bus because you wanted total control and she wouldn&#39;t give it up. Just like you stabbed Khall after he turned on his alliance FOR YOU.&quot;

&quot;That was a group decision! I couldn&#39;t trust him!&quot;

&quot;Hey, it can&#39;t be a group decision AND your decision!&quot; Rocky snaps. &quot;You gotta pick one!&quot;

&quot;Can we not do this right now!?&quot; Candace interjects, stepping between them. &quot;Rocky, get lost. Jennifer, just take a deep breath, and-&quot;

&quot;No! It&#39;s about time someone gave him a word or two!&quot; Jennifer protests.

//&quot;It was all happening in slow motion,&quot; says Candace. &quot;And not in the tranquil, bass reverb way. It was like watching someone swerve into a tree, and they can&#39;t hear you calling out to them. But I tried the best I could.&quot;//

&quot;Let him have it,&quot; says Rhett with a stone-cold expression.

&quot;No, you&#39;re better than this,&quot; Candace pleads.

&quot;Better than what? Than //me?//&quot; Rocky asks, mockingly. He steps around Candace, and stares right at Jennifer. &quot;You&#39;re not. You&#39;re just as guilty as I am, sweetheart. You&#39;re just as callous and tough as me, and you simply hate that maybe you&#39;ve met your match.&quot;

Jennifer responds by stepping towards Rocky herself and spitting directly onto his chest. In response, Rocky bares his teeth and makes an aggressive scowl, but remains quiet.

&quot;I have friends, Rocky,&quot; Jennifer replies coldly. &quot;And I have honour. Maybe we&#39;ll be equals if you ever decide to grow up.&quot; She steps back.

Rocky shakes his head, his scowl fading, and walks away.

Paula, Candace, and Rhett simply look at Jennifer with bewilderment.

//&quot;If Rocky wants to be all smug about winning, then he needs to be put in his place,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;If nothing else, then he should think twice next time before antagonizing someone. He picked the wrong person to mess with... not only can I fight back, but I can win.&quot;//

Ashleia, Buddy, and Vaclav are sitting in the shelter discussing the vote.

&quot;It looks like it&#39;s going to be between Denine and Louie tonight,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;Like, that&#39;s what the others are all saying. We wanted to do that anyways, right?&quot;

Vaclav nods. &quot;It makes sense. Buddy... who would you rather vote out? I could vote for either person.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m leaning towards Louie because he&#39;s lazy. The smaller this group gets, the more we have to do to keep ourselves healthy and safe. Louie freely admits he won&#39;t help us with that.&quot;

&quot;But there is another thing we should remember,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;We do still have an alliance of sorts with Louie. If Denine and Rocky are gone, he could come back to us. Denine is not going to do the same thing, right?&quot;

&quot;Would Louie even do that? I have trouble believing it,&quot; Buddy replies. &quot;Vaclav, you worked with him before. Where do you stand with him?&quot;

&quot;He... really was happy to see Denine again,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;He wants me to work with her, too. If we have to vote one out, in the end they will both be upset.&quot;

//&quot;I was hoping Rocky would not win,&quot; Vaclav admits. &quot;That way, people would want to vote him out, and I would not be asked whether I prefer Denine or Louie. I have an answer; I trust Louie more. But giving the answer would make me look like I am loyal to Louie, and not to them. Then they would vote me out for sure!&quot;//

Later on, Paula meets up with Louie to hear his pitch.

&quot;Thanks for coming,&quot; says Louie. &quot;Excuse the others – Rocky is moping about, Denine is probably doing her hair, and the townspeople say Vaclav is searching for Bigfoot.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re in a light-hearted mood for someone on the block,&quot; says Paula. &quot;But Rocky gave me a pitch the other day. Are you two on the same page?&quot;

&quot;I hope so, or he&#39;s getting a nasty surprise next time,&quot; Louie answers. &quot;Rhett is a pain in the ass. He and Jennifer. One of those two has to go, and I&#39;m willing to bet you would say no if I said we&#39;re voting Jennifer.&quot;

&quot;Probably,&quot; says Paula. &quot;You&#39;re saying you have Denine and Vaclav in on it too?&quot;

&quot;I should,&quot; says Louie. &quot;The three of us know we&#39;re on the bottom with Rocky safe. We&#39;re not turning on each other. Now the ball&#39;s in your court... do you want to have half the jury bitter at you for dooming them?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll make an enemy either way I turn tonight,&quot; says Paula. &quot;I need to think about who I want out tonight.&quot;

&quot;Fine, be evasive,&quot; says Louie.

&quot;Well, for the record,&quot; Paula replies, &quot;tonight people aren&#39;t sure. It&#39;s up in the air. But I&#39;m not going to put your name down tonight, no matter what the others tell me. Take that as you will.&quot;

//&quot;I would really rather want Denine out over Louie,&quot; says Paula, &quot;but I don&#39;t think I can push everyone to go against her. It seems like it&#39;s up to what Candace and Jennifer want. Vaclav as well, since he could go any which way. But majority or not, tonight is when I have to decide where in this tribe I end up.&quot;//

$v[**Tribal Council**]

The ten-strong Ochalibas tribe walks into the tribal council building with lit torches. They all place the torches behind their seats, then sit down.

$v[&quot;Welcome back,&quot; says Vincent. &quot;Rocky, you have been put in the hot seat repeatedly. Would tonight have been another of those times had you not won immunity?&quot;]

Rocky nods. &quot;It was clear that this was the worst-case scenario for everyone except me. It really sucks. But now there&#39;s no safe bet for the others, so maybe something is bound to change tonight.&quot;

$v[&quot;Ashleia, is Rocky right? Were you really blindsided by his win, or was there something else in the works from the start?&quot;]

&quot;It&#39;s kind of both,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;There&#39;s now a majority and a minority, and Rocky was just not part of the majority. We aren&#39;t coming in here with no idea how the vote will go down.&quot;

&quot;Then mind enlightening the rest of us?&quot; Denine asks.

&quot;Uhh, yeah I do mind,&quot; says Ashleia. &quot;It&#39;s, like, none of your business?&quot;

&quot;If it involves me possibly getting voted out, then it&#39;s totally my business,&quot; Denine replies.

$v[&quot;Denine, you see yourself as being in danger?&quot;]

&quot;Of course. Jennifer and Paula have it out for me because of what happened at the swap.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t have it out for you, Denine, I never did,&quot; Jennifer replies.

&quot;Suuuuuuuure.&quot; Denine rolls her eyes. &quot;You have it out for everyone who crosses you in some way.&quot;

&quot;You flat out blew me off,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;How was I supposed to trust you when I had four people saying they would actually listen to me?&quot;

&quot;If Khall listened to you, then why did you vote him out?&quot; Denine replies.

&quot;He was unpredictable,&quot; Jennifer counters.

&quot;...Fine.&quot; Denine crosses her arms. &quot;In that case, that was my reasoning as well.&quot;

$v[&quot;Candace, does it make sense to say that history is more important than potential tonight?&quot;]

&quot;It seems to be that way,&quot; says Candace. &quot;The people we&#39;ve been considering voting out are ones that have isolated themselves from the tribe emotionally. Denine and Louie are a pair at the expense of the rest of us, so we are struggling to really parse between them.&quot;

$v[&quot;Vaclav, is it up in the air between those two for everyone?&quot;]

&quot;Some of us have an idea of who we would rather go home,&quot; says Vaclav. &quot;We cannot vote them both out tonight, so a choice has to be made. It would be naïve to assume they will act the exact same as each other if one is voted out.&quot;

$v[&quot;Louie, this is definitely not good news for you and Denine.&quot;]

&quot;I expected it,&quot; says Louie. &quot;I don&#39;t have the best reputation, neither does she. But there&#39;s always the option to keep us both. You&#39;ll be able to save two people at once, and we won&#39;t hold anything against someone who does just that.&quot;

&quot;It will also show like you aren&#39;t like the rest of your allies,&quot; Denine adds, &quot;and that you&#39;re playing your own game. If you want to make the end with an agenda only you can take credit for, you don&#39;t want to be the one who missed their shot.&quot;

$v[&quot;Rocky, with all this unfolding because you&#39;re immune, do you think it&#39;s better to stand in solidarity with them, or take the chance to earn back the trust and respect of your peers back?&quot;]

&quot;The latter isn&#39;t happening tonight of all nights, especially not from Jennifer,&quot; says Rocky. &quot;If anything, I&#39;m just going to go against whatever she does since she horked a big one on me.&quot;

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; says Paula, &quot;but what exactly does &#39;horked a big one&#39; mean?&quot;

&quot;She spat right on my chest, soiling my second favourite shirt,&quot; Rocky replies.

Buddy&#39;s eyes go wide open. &quot;She what?&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s right,&quot; says Rhett. &quot;It was unexpected.&quot;

$v[&quot;Jennifer. Am I hearing this correctly? You spat directly on Rocky?&quot;]

&quot;He was rubbing his immunity in my face, and he was trying to badmouth me in front of my own allies,&quot; Jennifer explains. &quot;I couldn&#39;t stand for that.&quot;

Rocky&#39;s expression turns sullen, much to the surprise of Denine.

&quot;I mean, we were all thinking it,&quot; says Buddy. &quot;But it&#39;s another thing to do it.&quot;

&quot;It seems to have shut him up tonight for the most part,&quot; says Jennifer. &quot;Maybe he&#39;ll learn something from this so we can all put this stupid back-and-forth behind us. Rocky, just admit you were being a tool and we&#39;ll stop treating you like one.&quot;

Rocky looks over at Jennifer. &quot;You don&#39;t control me. You don&#39;t control anyone else here, either. I&#39;m not going to kneel before you so that you come out of this looking good.&quot;

&quot;Well, I gave you a chance.&quot; Jennifer flips her hair.

Rocky rests his elbow on one leg and presses his fist against the side of his face. He quietly sighs and rolls his eyes.

$v[&quot;And with that in mind, it sounds like we are ready to vote.&quot;] Vincent crosses his arms. $v[&quot;But not tonight.&quot;]

&quot;That&#39;s a bummer,&quot; says Denine, suddenly grinning from ear to ear.

$v[&quot;In light of the circumstances, and what has been revealed to me tonight, I am stepping in and cancelling tribal council.&quot;]

Everyone looks on, all looking confused or worried except for Denine and Louie.

$v[&quot;**Jennifer**. What you admitted to tonight counts as an assault against another competitor.&quot;]

Jennifer looks stunned. &quot;That&#39;s total bullshit! People have done worse on this series, and he was the one who instigated it!&quot;

&quot;I warned you to step back and not escalate it, Jen,&quot; says Candace.

&quot;I hardly escalated!&quot; Jennifer exclaims. &quot;Rhett, back me up here!&quot;

Rhett looks upset. &quot;I have my suspicions about this sudden ruling, but you made a decision, and these are apparently the consequences.&quot;

$v[&quot;Don&#39;t try to claim there&#39;s a precedent, Jennifer,&quot;] says Vincent sternly. $v[&quot;Since I have taken over, I have refused to tolerate violence, and you cannot claim you acted in self-defence. Bring me your torch.&quot;]

Jennifer&#39;s expression turns sour. She gets up slowly to retrieve her torch, fumbles a bit with the torches, and then brings hers to Vincent. The other competitors are silent.

Vincent snuffs Jennifer&#39;s torch. $v[&quot;Thank you. Time for you to head out.&quot;]

Jennifer shakes her head. &quot;Fuck you, Rocky,&quot; she mutters as she walks out.

Vincent turns to the final nine. $v[&quot;In this game, you have to adapt to whatever is thrown at you. It took only one mistake at the challenge to ruin Jennifer&#39;s plan today, and she could not come back from that. Let&#39;s hope you all can adapt better than she could. You can head back to camp.&quot;]
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$m[&quot;I didn&#39;t think it would end this way, but I didn&#39;t think I would meet someone like Rocky,&quot; Jennifer confesses. &quot;Your physical, mental, and emotional capabilities are put to the test out here, and I hit a breaking point. I may have lost, but I still have my passion. I&#39;m sitting here with more integrity than some people still in this game have ever had. Now hopefully Rhett can put the vote steal I wedged in his torch to good use.&quot;]
